en|a computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of
en|arithmetic or logical operations computation modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations
en|known as programs these programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks the
en|term computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware operating
en|system software and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation or to a group
en|of computers that are linked and function together such as a computer network or computer
en|cluster a broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems including
en|simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls and factory devices like industrial
en|robots computers are at the core of general purpose devices such as personal computers and
en|mobile devices such as smartphones computers power the internet which links billions of computers and
en|users early computers were meant to be used only for calculations simple manual instruments like
en|the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times early in the industrial
en|revolution some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks such as guiding patterns
en|for looms more sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early th century
en|the first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during world war ii both electromechanical and
en|using thermionic valves the first semiconductor transistors in the late s were followed by the
en|silicon based mosfet mos transistor and monolithic integrated circuit chip technologies in the late s
en|leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the s the speed power and
en|versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then with transistor counts increasing at
en|a rapid pace moore s law noted that counts doubled every two years leading to
en|the digital revolution during the late th to early st centuries conventionally a modern computer
en|consists of at least one processing element typically a central processing unit cpu in the
en|form of a microprocessor together with some type of computer memory typically semiconductor memory chips
en|the processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations and a sequencing and control unit

en|be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be
en|saved and retrieved it was not until the mid th century that the word acquired
en|its modern definition according to the oxford english dictionary the first known use of the
en|word computer was in a different sense in a book called the yong mans gleanings
en|by the english writer richard brathwait i haue sic read the truest computer of times
en|and the best arithmetician that euer sic breathed and he reduceth thy dayes into a
en|short number this usage of the term referred to a human computer a person who
en|carried out calculations or computations the word continued with the same meaning until the middle
en|of the th century during the latter part of this period women were often hired
en|as computers because they could be paid less than their male counterparts by most human
en|computers were women the online etymology dictionary gives the first attested use of computer in
en|the s meaning one who calculates this is an agent noun from compute v the
en|online etymology dictionary states that the use of the term to mean calculating machine of
en|any type is from the online etymology dictionary indicates that the modern use of the
en|term to mean programmable digital electronic computer dates from under this name in a theoretical
en|sense from as turing machine the name has remained although modern computers are capable of
en|many higher level functions devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years
en|mostly using one to one correspondence with fingers the earliest counting device was most likely
en|a form of tally stick later record keeping aids throughout the fertile crescent included calculi
en|clay spheres cones etc which represented counts of items likely livestock or grains sealed in
en|hollow unbaked clay containers a the use of counting rods is one example the abacus
en|was initially used for arithmetic tasks the roman abacus was developed from devices used in
en|babylonia as early as bce since then many other forms of reckoning boards or tables
en|have been invented in a medieval european counting house a checkered cloth would be placed

en|known mechanical analog computer according to derek j de solla price it was designed to
en|calculate astronomical positions it was discovered in in the antikythera wreck off the greek island
en|of antikythera between kythera and crete and has been dated to approximately c â€‰ bce
en|devices of comparable complexity to the antikythera mechanism would not reappear until the fourteenth century
en|many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use the
en|planisphere was a star chart invented by ab rayh n al b r n in
en|the early th century the astrolabe was invented in the hellenistic world in either the
en|st or nd centuries bce and is often attributed to hipparchus a combination of the
en|planisphere and dioptra the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several
en|different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy an astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and
en|gear wheels was invented by abi bakr of isfahan persia in ab rayh n al
en|b r n invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe an early fixed wired

en|keeping track of leap years and varying day length the tide predicting machine invented by
en|the scottish scientist sir william thomson in was of great utility to navigation in shallow
en|waters it used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels
en|for a set period at a particular location the differential analyser a mechanical analog computer
en|designed to solve differential equations by integration used wheel and disc mechanisms to perform the
en|integration in sir william thomson had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators but
en|he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ball and disk integrators
en|in a differential analyzer the output of one integrator drove the input of the next
en|integrator or a graphing output the torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines
en|to work starting in the s vannevar bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers in
en|the s the spanish engineer leonardo torres quevedo began to develop a series of advanced
en|analog machines that could solve real and complex roots of polynomials which were published in
en|by the paris academy of sciences charles babbage an english mechanical engineer and polymath originated
en|the concept of a programmable computer considered the father of the computer he conceptualized and
en|invented the first mechanical computer in the early th century after working on his difference
en|engine he announced his invention in in a paper to the royal astronomical society titled
en|note on the application of machinery to the computation of astronomical and mathematical tables he
en|also designed to aid in navigational calculations in he realized that a much more general
en|design an analytical engine was possible the input of programs and data was to be
en|provided to the machine via punched cards a method being used at the time to
en|direct mechanical looms such as the jacquard loom for output the machine would have a
en|printer a curve plotter and a bell the machine would also be able to punch
en|numbers onto cards to be read in later the engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit
en|control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops and integrated memory making it
en|the first design for a general purpose computer that could be described in modern terms
en|as turing complete the machine was about a century ahead of its time all the
en|parts for his machine had to be made by hand this was a major problem
en|for a device with thousands of parts eventually the project was dissolved with the decision
en|of the british government to cease funding babbage s failure to complete the analytical engine
en|can be chiefly attributed to political and financial difficulties as well as his desire to
en|develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow
en|nevertheless his son henry babbage completed a simplified version of the analytical engine s computing
en|unit the mill in he gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables
en|in in his work essays on automatics published in leonardo torres quevedo wrote a brief
en|history of babbage s efforts at constructing a mechanical difference engine and analytical engine he
en|described the analytical engine as exemplifying his theories about the potential power of machines and
en|takes the problem of designing such an engine as a challenge to his skills as
en|an inventor of electromechanical devices the paper contains a design of a machine capable of
en|calculating completely automatically the value of the formula a x y z displaystyle a x
en|y z for a sequence of sets of values of the variables involved the whole
en|machine was to be controlled by a read only program which was complete with provisions
en|for conditional branching he also introduced the idea of floating point arithmetic in to celebrate
en|the th anniversary of the invention of the arithmometer torres presented in paris the electromechanical
en|arithmometer which consisted of an arithmetic unit connected to a possibly remote typewriter on which
en|commands could be typed and the results printed automatically demonstrating the feasibility of an electromechanical
en|analytical engine during the first half of the th century many scientific computing needs were
en|met by increasingly sophisticated analog computers which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of
en|the problem as a basis for computation however these were not programmable and generally lacked
en|the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers the first modern analog computer was a
en|tide predicting machine invented by sir william thomson later to become lord kelvin in the
en|differential analyser a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel
en|and disc mechanisms was conceptualized in by james thomson the elder brother of the more
en|famous sir william thomson the art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the
en|differential analyzer built by h l hazen and vannevar bush at mit starting in this
en|built on the mechanical integrators of james thomson and the torque amplifiers invented by h
en|w nieman a dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious by
en|the s the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog
en|computing machines but analog computers remained in use during the s in some specialized applications
en|such as education slide rule and aircraft control systems by the united states navy had
en|developed an electromechanical analog computer small enough to use aboard a submarine this was the
en|torpedo data computer which used trigonometry to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at
en|a moving target during world war ii similar devices were developed in other countries as
en|well early digital computers were electromechanical electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation
en|these devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all
en|electric computers originally using vacuum tubes the z created by german engineer konrad zuse in
en|in berlin was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer in zuse
en|followed his earlier machine up with the z the world s first working electromechanical programmable
en|fully automatic digital computer the z was built with relays implementing a bit word length
en|that operated at a clock frequency of about hz program code was supplied on punched
en|film while data could be stored in words of memory or supplied from the keyboard
en|it was quite similar to modern machines in some respects pioneering numerous advances such as
en|floating point numbers rather than the harder to implement decimal system used in charles babbage
en|s earlier design using a binary system meant that zuse s machines were easier to
en|build and potentially more reliable given the technologies available at that time the z was
en|not itself a universal computer but could be extended to be turing complete zuse s
en|next computer the z became the world s first commercial computer after initial delay due
en|to the second world war it was completed in and delivered to the eth zurich
en|the computer was manufactured by zuse s own company zuse kg which was founded in
en|as the first company with the sole purpose of developing computers in berlin purely electronic
en|circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents at the same time that digital
en|calculation replaced analog the engineer tommy flowers working at the post office research station in
en|london in the s began to explore the possible use of electronics for the telephone
en|exchange experimental equipment that he built in went into operation five years later converting a
en|portion of the telephone exchange network into an electronic data processing system using thousands of
en|vacuum tubes in the us john vincent atanasoff and clifford e berry of iowa state
en|university developed and tested the atanasoff berry computer abc in the first automatic electronic digital
en|computer this design was also all electronic and used about vacuum tubes with capacitors fixed
en|in a mechanically rotating drum for memory during world war ii the british code breakers
en|at bletchley park achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted german military communications the
en|german encryption machine enigma was first attacked with the help of the electro mechanical bombes
en|which were often run by women to crack the more sophisticated german lorenz sz machine
en|used for high level army communications max newman and his colleagues commissioned flowers to build
en|the colossus he spent eleven months from early february designing and building the first colossus
en|after a functional test in december colossus was shipped to bletchley park where it was
en|delivered on january and attacked its first message on february colossus was the world s
en|first electronic digital programmable computer it used a large number of valves vacuum tubes it
en|had paper tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of
en|boolean logical operations on its data but it was not turing complete nine mk ii
en|colossi were built the mk i was converted to a mk ii making ten machines
en|in total colossus mark i contained thermionic valves tubes but mark ii with valves was
en|both five times faster and simpler to operate than mark i greatly speeding the decoding
en|process the eniac electronic numerical integrator and computer was the first electronic programmable computer built
en|in the u s although the eniac was similar to the colossus it was much
en|faster more flexible and it was turing complete like the colossus a program on the
en|eniac was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches a far cry
en|from the stored program electronic machines that came later once a program was written it
en|had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches
en|the programmers of the eniac were six women often known collectively as the eniac girls
en|it combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many
en|complex problems it could add or subtract times a second a thousand times faster than
en|any other machine it also had modules to multiply divide and square root high speed
en|memory was limited to words about bytes built under the direction of john mauchly and
en|j presper eckert at the university of pennsylvania eniac s development and construction lasted from
en|to full operation at the end of the machine was huge weighing tons using kilowatts
en|of electric power and contained over vacuum tubes relays and hundreds of thousands of resistors
en|capacitors and inductors the principle of the modern computer was proposed by alan turing in
en|his seminal paper on computable numbers turing proposed a simple device that he called universal
en|computing machine and that is now known as a universal turing machine he proved that
en|such a machine is capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions program
en|stored on tape allowing the machine to be programmable the fundamental concept of turing s
en|design is the stored program where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory
en|von neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this
en|paper turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of
en|computation except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores modern computers are said
en|to be turing complete which is to say they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to
en|a universal turing machine early computing machines had fixed programs changing its function required the
en|re wiring and re structuring of the machine with the proposal of the stored program
en|computer this changed a stored program computer includes by design an instruction set and can
en|store in memory a set of instructions a program that details the computation the theoretical
en|basis for the stored program computer was laid out by alan turing in his paper
en|in turing joined the national physical laboratory and began work on developing an electronic stored
en|program digital computer his report proposed electronic calculator was the first specification for such a
en|device john von neumann at the university of pennsylvania also circulated his first draft of
en|a report on the edvac in the manchester baby was the world s first stored
en|program computer it was built at the university of manchester in england by frederic c
en|williams tom kilburn and geoff tootill and ran its first program on june it was
en|designed as a testbed for the williams tube the first random access digital storage device
en|although the computer was described as small and primitive by a retrospective it was the
en|first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic computer
en|as soon as the baby had demonstrated the feasibility of its design a project began
en|at the university to develop it into a practically useful computer the manchester mark the
en|mark in turn quickly became the prototype for the ferranti mark the world s first
en|commercially available general purpose computer built by ferranti it was delivered to the university of
en|manchester in february at least seven of these later machines were delivered between and one
en|of them to shell labs in amsterdam in october the directors of british catering company
en|j lyons company decided to take an active role in promoting the commercial development of
en|computers lyons s leo i computer modelled closely on the cambridge edsac of became operational
en|in april and ran the world s first routine office computer job grace hopper was
en|the first to develop a compiler for a programming language the concept of a field
en|effect transistor was proposed by julius edgar lilienfeld in john bardeen and walter brattain while
en|working under william shockley at bell labs built the first working transistor the point contact
en|transistor in which was followed by shockley s bipolar junction transistor in from onwards transistors
en|replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs giving rise to the second generation of computers compared
en|to vacuum tubes transistors have many advantages they are smaller and require less power than
en|vacuum tubes so give off less heat junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum
en|tubes and had longer indefinite service life transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of
en|binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space however early junction transistors were relatively bulky
en|devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass production basis which limited them to
en|a number of specialized applications at the university of manchester a team under the leadership
en|of tom kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of
en|valves their first transistorized computer and the first in the world was operational by and
en|a second version was completed there in april however the machine did make use of
en|valves to generate its Â khz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and
en|write on its magnetic drum memory so it was not the first completely transistorized computer
en|that distinction goes to the harwell cadet of built by the electronics division of the
en|atomic energy research establishment at harwell the metal oxide silicon field effect transistor mosfet also
en|known as the mos transistor was invented by mohamed m atalla and dawon kahng at
en|bell labs in it was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturized and
en|mass produced for a wide range of uses with its high scalability and much lower
en|power consumption and higher density than bipolar junction transistors the mosfet made it possible to
en|build high density integrated circuits in addition to data processing it also enabled the practical
en|use of mos transistors as memory cell storage elements leading to the development of mos
en|semiconductor memory which replaced earlier magnetic core memory in computers the mosfet led to the
en|microcomputer revolution and became the driving force behind the computer revolution the mosfet is the
en|most widely used transistor in computers and is the fundamental building block of digital electronics
en|the next great advance in computing power came with the advent of the integrated circuit
en|ic the idea of the integrated circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist working
en|for the royal radar establishment of the ministry of defence geoffrey w a dummer dummer
en|presented the first public description of an integrated circuit at the symposium on progress in
en|quality electronic components in washington Â d c on may the first working ics were
en|invented by jack kilby at texas instruments and robert noyce at fairchild semiconductor kilby recorded
en|his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in july successfully demonstrating the first working integrated
en|example on september in his patent application of february kilby described his new device as
en|a body of semiconductor materialÂ wherein all the components of the electronic circuit are completely
en|integrated however kilby s invention was a hybrid integrated circuit hybrid ic rather than a
en|monolithic integrated circuit ic chip kilby s ic had external wire connections which made it
en|difficult to mass produce noyce also came up with his own idea of an integrated
en|circuit half a year later than kilby noyce s invention was the first true monolithic
en|ic chip his chip solved many practical problems that kilby s had not produced at
en|fairchild semiconductor it was made of silicon whereas kilby s chip was made of germanium
en|noyce s monolithic ic was fabricated using the planar process developed by his colleague jean
en|hoerni in early in turn the planar process was based on mohamed m atalla s
en|work on semiconductor surface passivation by silicon dioxide in the late s modern monolithic ics
en|are predominantly mos metal oxide semiconductor integrated circuits built from mosfets mos transistors the earliest
en|experimental mos ic to be fabricated was a transistor chip built by fred heiman and
en|steven hofstein at rca in general microelectronics later introduced the first commercial mos ic in
en|developed by robert norman following the development of the self aligned gate silicon gate mos
en|transistor by robert kerwin donald klein and john sarace at bell labs in the first
en|silicon gate mos ic with self aligned gates was developed by federico faggin at fairchild
en|semiconductor in the mosfet has since become the most critical device component in modern ics
en|the development of the mos integrated circuit led to the invention of the microprocessor and
en|heralded an explosion in the commercial and personal use of computers while the subject of
en|exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious partly due to lack of agreement
en|on the exact definition of the term microprocessor it is largely undisputed that the first
en|single chip microprocessor was the intel designed and realized by federico faggin with his silicon
en|gate mos ic technology along with ted hoff masatoshi shima and stanley mazor at intel
en|b in the early s mos ic technology enabled the integration of more than transistors
en|on a single chip system on a chip socs are complete computers on a microchip
en|or chip the size of a coin they may or may not have integrated ram
en|and flash memory if not integrated the ram is usually placed directly above known as
en|package on package or below on the opposite side of the circuit board the soc
en|and the flash memory is usually placed right next to the soc this all done
en|to improve data transfer speeds as the data signals do not have to travel long
en|distances since eniac in computers have advanced enormously with modern socs such as the snapdragon
en|being the size of a coin while also being hundreds of thousands of times more
en|powerful than eniac integrating billions of transistors and consuming only a few watts of power
en|the first mobile computers were heavy and ran from mains power the Â lb Â
en|kg ibm was an early example later portables such as the osborne and compaq portable
en|were considerably lighter but still needed to be plugged in the first laptops such as
en|the grid compass removed this requirement by incorporating batteries and with the continued miniaturization of
en|computing resources and advancements in portable battery life portable computers grew in popularity in the
en|s the same developments allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular mobile phones by
en|the early s these smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating systems and
en|recently became the dominant computing device on the market these are powered by system on
en|a chip socs which are complete computers on a microchip the size of a coin
en|computers can be classified in a number of different ways including the term hardware covers
en|all of those parts of a computer that are tangible physical objects circuits computer chips
en|graphic cards sound cards memory ram motherboard displays power supplies cables keyboards printers and mice
en|input devices are all hardware a general purpose computer has four main components the arithmetic
en|logic unit alu the control unit the memory and the input and output devices collectively
en|termed i o these parts are interconnected by buses often made of groups of wires
en|inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small electrical circuits which can
en|be turned off or on by means of an electronic switch each circuit represents a
en|bit binary digit of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a
en|and when off it represents a in positive logic representation the circuits are arranged in
en|logic gates so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of
en|one or more of the other circuits when unprocessed data is sent to the computer
en|with the help of input devices the data is processed and sent to output devices
en|the input devices may be hand operated or automated the act of processing is mainly
en|regulated by the cpu some examples of input devices are the means through which computer
en|gives output are known as output devices some examples of output devices are the control
en|unit often called a control system or central controller manages the computer s various components
en|it reads and interprets decodes the program instructions transforming them into control signals that activate
en|other parts of the computer d control systems in advanced computers may change the order
en|of execution of some instructions to improve performance a key component common to all cpus
en|is the program counter a special memory cell a register that keeps track of which
en|location in memory the next instruction is to be read from e the control system
en|s function is as follows this is a simplified description and some of these steps
en|may be performed concurrently or in a different order depending on the type of cpu
en|since the program counter is conceptually just another set of memory cells it can be
en|changed by calculations done in the alu adding to the program counter would cause the
en|next instruction to be read from a place locations further down the program instructions that
en|modify the program counter are often known as jumps and allow for loops instructions that
en|are repeated by the computer and often conditional instruction execution both examples of control flow
en|the sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is
en|in itself like a short computer program and indeed in some more complex cpu designs
en|there is another yet smaller computer called a microsequencer which runs a microcode program that
en|causes all of these events to happen the control unit alu and registers are collectively
en|known as a central processing unit cpu early cpus were composed of many separate components
en|since the s cpus have typically been constructed on a single mos integrated circuit chip
en|called a microprocessor the alu is capable of performing two classes of operations arithmetic and
en|logic the set of arithmetic operations that a particular alu supports may be limited to
en|addition and subtraction or might include multiplication division trigonometry functions such as sine cosine etc
en|and square roots some can operate only on whole numbers integers while others use floating
en|point to represent real numbers albeit with limited precision however any computer that is capable
en|of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex
en|operations into simple steps that it can perform therefore any computer can be programmed to
en|perform any arithmetic operation although it will take more time to do so if its
en|alu does not directly support the operation an alu may also compare numbers and return
en|boolean truth values true or false depending on whether one is equal to greater than
en|or less than the other is greater than logic operations involve boolean logic and or
en|xor and not these can be useful for creating complicated conditional statements and processing boolean
en|logic superscalar computers may contain multiple alus allowing them to process several instructions simultaneously graphics
en|processors and computers with simd and mimd features often contain alus that can perform arithmetic
en|on vectors and matrices a computer s memory can be viewed as a list of
en|cells into which numbers can be placed or read each cell has a numbered address
en|and can store a single number the computer can be instructed to put the number
en|into the cell numbered or to add the number that is in cell to the
en|number that is in cell and put the answer into cell the information stored in
en|memory may represent practically anything letters numbers even computer instructions can be placed into memory
en|with equal ease since the cpu does not differentiate between different types of information it
en|is the software s responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing
en|but a series of numbers in almost all modern computers each memory cell is set
en|up to store binary numbers in groups of eight bits called a byte each byte
en|is able to represent different numbers either from to or to to store larger numbers
en|several consecutive bytes may be used typically two four or eight when negative numbers are
en|required they are usually stored in two s complement notation other arrangements are possible but
en|are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts a computer can store
en|any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically modern computers have
en|billions or even trillions of bytes of memory the cpu contains a special set of
en|memory cells called registers that can be read and written to much more rapidly than
en|the main memory area there are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on
en|the type of cpu registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to
en|avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed as data is constantly
en|being worked on reducing the need to access main memory which is often slow compared
en|to the alu and control units greatly increases the computer s speed computer main memory
en|comes in two principal varieties ram can be read and written to anytime the cpu
en|commands it but rom is preloaded with data and software that never changes therefore the
en|cpu can only read from it rom is typically used to store the computer s
en|initial start up instructions in general the contents of ram are erased when the power
en|to the computer is turned off but rom retains its data indefinitely in a pc
en|the rom contains a specialized program called the bios that orchestrates loading the computer s
en|operating system from the hard disk drive into ram whenever the computer is turned on
en|or reset in embedded computers which frequently do not have disk drives all of the
en|required software may be stored in rom software stored in rom is often called firmware
en|because it is notionally more like hardware than software flash memory blurs the distinction between
en|rom and ram as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable
en|it is typically much slower than conventional rom and ram however so its use is
en|restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary f in more sophisticated computers there may
en|be one or more ram cache memories which are slower than registers but faster than
en|main memory generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed
en|data into the cache automatically often without the need for any intervention on the programmer
en|s part i o is the means by which a computer exchanges information with the
en|outside world devices that provide input or output to the computer are called peripherals on
en|a typical personal computer peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and mouse and output
en|devices such as the display and printer hard disk drives floppy disk drives and optical
en|disc drives serve as both input and output devices computer networking is another form of
en|i o i o devices are often complex computers in their own right with their
en|own cpu and memory a graphics processing unit might contain fifty or more tiny computers
en|that perform the calculations necessary to display d graphics citation needed modern desktop computers contain
en|many smaller computers that assist the main cpu in performing i o a era flat
en|screen display contains its own computer circuitry while a computer may be viewed as running
en|one gigantic program stored in its main memory in some systems it is necessary to
en|give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously this is achieved by multitasking i e
en|having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn one means by which
en|this is done is with a special signal called an interrupt which can periodically cause
en|the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead by
en|remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt the computer can return to that
en|task later if several programs are running at the same time then the interrupt generator
en|might be causing several hundred interrupts per second causing a program switch each time since
en|modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception it may
en|appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is
en|ever executing in any given instant this method of multitasking is sometimes termed time sharing
en|since each program is allocated a slice of time in turn before the era of
en|inexpensive computers the principal use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the
en|same computer seemingly multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to
en|run more slowly in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running but
en|most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input output devices to complete
en|their tasks if a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse
en|or press a key on the keyboard then it will not take a time slice
en|until the event it is waiting for has occurred this frees up time for other
en|programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss
en|some computers are designed to distribute their work across several cpus in a multiprocessing configuration
en|a technique once employed in only large and powerful machines such as supercomputers mainframe computers
en|and servers multiprocessor and multi core multiple cpus on a single integrated circuit personal and
en|laptop computers are now widely available and are being increasingly used in lower end markets
en|as a result supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from
en|the basic stored program architecture and from general purpose computers g they often feature thousands
en|of cpus customized high speed interconnects and specialized computing hardware such designs tend to be
en|useful for only specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to
en|use most of the available resources at once supercomputers usually see usage in large scale
en|simulation graphics rendering and cryptography applications as well as with other so called embarrassingly parallel
en|tasks software refers to parts of the computer which do not have a material form
en|such as programs data protocols etc software is that part of a computer system that
en|consists of encoded information or computer instructions in contrast to the physical hardware from which
en|the system is built computer software includes computer programs libraries and related non executable data
en|such as online documentation or digital media it is often divided into system software and
en|application software computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used
en|on its own when software is stored in hardware that cannot easily be modified such
en|as with bios rom in an ibm pc compatible computer it is sometimes called firmware
en|there are thousands of different programming languages some intended for general purpose others useful for
en|only highly specialized applications the defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all
en|other machines is that they can be programmed that is to say that some type
en|of instructions the program can be given to the computer and it will process them
en|modern computers based on the von neumann architecture often have machine code in the form
en|of an imperative programming language in practical terms a computer program may be just a
en|few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions as do the programs for word
en|processors and web browsers for example a typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions
en|per second gigaflops and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation large computer
en|programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of programmers years to write and
en|due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors this section applies to
en|most common ram machine based computers in most cases computer instructions are simple add one
en|number to another move some data from one location to another send a message to
en|some external device etc these instructions are read from the computer s memory and are
en|generally carried out executed in the order they were given however there are usually specialized
en|instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in
en|the program and to carry on executing from there these are called jump instructions or
en|branches furthermore jump instructions may be made to happen conditionally so that different sequences of
en|instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external
en|event many computers directly support subroutines by providing a type of jump that remembers the
en|location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump
en|instruction program execution might be likened to reading a book while a person will normally
en|read each word and line in sequence they may at times jump back to an
en|earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest similarly a
en|computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program
en|over and over again until some internal condition is met this is called the flow
en|of control within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks
en|repeatedly without human intervention comparatively a person using a pocket calculator can perform a basic
en|arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses but to
en|add together all of the numbers from to would take thousands of button presses and
en|a lot of time with a near certainty of making a mistake on the other
en|hand a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions
en|the following example is written in the mips assembly language once told to run this
en|program the computer will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention it will
en|almost never make a mistake and a modern pc can complete the task in a
en|fraction of a second in most computers individual instructions are stored as machine code with
en|each instruction being given a unique number its operation code or opcode for short the
en|command to add two numbers together would have one opcode the command to multiply them
en|would have a different opcode and so on the simplest computers are able to perform
en|any of a handful of different instructions the more complex computers have several hundred to
en|choose from each with a unique numerical code since the computer s memory is able
en|to store numbers it can also store the instruction codes this leads to the important
en|fact that entire programs which are just lists of these instructions can be represented as
en|lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way
en|as numeric data the fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer s memory alongside
en|the data they operate on is the crux of the von neumann or stored program
en|architecture in some cases a computer might store some or all of its program in
en|memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on this is called the
en|harvard architecture after the harvard mark i computer modern von neumann computers display some traits
en|of the harvard architecture in their designs such as in cpu caches while it is
en|possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers machine language and while this
en|technique was used with many early computers h it is extremely tedious and potentially error
en|prone to do so in practice especially for complicated programs instead each basic instruction can
en|be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to rememberÂ
en|a mnemonic such as add sub mult or jump these mnemonics are collectively known as
en|a computer s assembly language converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer
en|can actually understand machine language is usually done by a computer program called an assembler
en|programming languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run unlike natural languages
en|programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise they are purely
en|written languages and are often difficult to read aloud they are generally either translated into
en|machine code by a compiler or an assembler before being run or translated directly at
en|run time by an interpreter sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the
en|two techniques machine languages and the assembly languages that represent them collectively termed low level
en|programming languages are generally unique to the particular architecture of a computer s central processing
en|unit cpu for instance an arm architecture cpu such as may be found in a
en|smartphone or a hand held videogame cannot understand the machine language of an x cpu
en|that might be in a pc i historically a significant number of other cpu architectures
en|were created and saw extensive use notably including the mos technology and in addition to
en|the zilog z although considerably easier than in machine language writing long programs in assembly
en|language is often difficult and is also error prone therefore most practical programs are written
en|in more abstract high level programming languages that are able to express the needs of
en|the programmer more conveniently and thereby help reduce programmer error high level languages are usually
en|compiled into machine language or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language using
en|another computer program called a compiler j high level languages are less related to the
en|workings of the target computer than assembly language and more related to the language and
en|structure of the problem s to be solved by the final program it is therefore
en|often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into
en|the machine language of many different types of computer this is part of the means
en|by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such
en|as personal computers and various video game consoles program design of small programs is relatively
en|simple and involves the analysis of the problem collection of inputs using the programming constructs
en|within languages devising or using established procedures and algorithms providing data for output devices and
en|solutions to the problem as applicable as problems become larger and more complex features such
en|as subprograms modules formal documentation and new paradigms such as object oriented programming are encountered
en|large programs involving thousands of line of code and more require formal software methodologies the
en|task of developing large software systems presents a significant intellectual challenge producing software with an
en|acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has historically been difficult the academic
en|and professional discipline of software engineering concentrates specifically on this challenge errors in computer programs
en|are called bugs they may be benign and not affect the usefulness of the program
en|or have only subtle effects however in some cases they may cause the program or
en|the entire system to hang becoming unresponsive to input such as mouse clicks or keystrokes
en|to completely fail or to crash otherwise benign bugs may sometimes be harnessed for malicious
en|intent by an unscrupulous user writing an exploit code designed to take advantage of a
en|bug and disrupt a computer s proper execution bugs are usually not the fault of
en|the computer since computers merely execute the instructions they are given bugs are nearly always
en|the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the program s design k
en|admiral grace hopper an american computer scientist and developer of the first compiler is credited
en|for having first used the term bugs in computing after a dead moth was found
en|shorting a relay in the harvard mark ii computer in september computers have been used
en|to coordinate information between multiple locations since the s the u s military s sage
en|system was the first large scale example of such a system which led to a
en|number of special purpose commercial systems such as sabre in the s computer engineers at
en|research institutions throughout the united states began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology
en|the effort was funded by arpa now darpa and the computer network that resulted was
en|called the arpanet the technologies that made the arpanet possible spread and evolved in time
en|the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the internet the
en|emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer computer
en|operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the
en|resources of other computers on the network such as peripheral devices stored information and the
en|like as extensions of the resources of an individual computer initially these facilities were available
en|primarily to people working in high tech environments but in the s the spread of
en|applications like e mail and the world wide web combined with the development of cheap
en|fast networking technologies like ethernet and adsl saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous in fact
en|the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally a very large proportion of
en|personal computers regularly connect to the internet to communicate and receive information wireless networking often
en|utilizing mobile phone networks has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing
en|environments a computer does not need to be electronic nor even have a processor nor
en|ram nor even a hard disk while popular usage of the word computer is synonymous
en|with a personal electronic computer l a typical modern definition of a computer is a
en|device that computes especially a programmable usually electronic machine that performs high speed mathematical or
en|logical operations or that assembles stores correlates or otherwise processes information according to this definition
en|any device that processes information qualifies as a computer there is active research to make
en|non classical computers out of many promising new types of technology such as optical computers
en|dna computers neural computers and quantum computers most computers are universal and are able to
en|calculate any computable function and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed
en|however different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems for example
en|quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms by quantum factoring very quickly there
en|are many types of computer architectures of all these abstract machines a quantum computer holds
en|the most promise for revolutionizing computing logic gates are a common abstraction which can apply
en|to most of the above digital or analog paradigms the ability to store and execute
en|lists of instructions called programs makes computers extremely versatile distinguishing them from calculators the church
en|turing thesis is a mathematical statement of this versatility any computer with a minimum capability
en|being turing complete is in principle capable of performing the same tasks that any other
en|computer can perform therefore any type of computer netbook supercomputer cellular automaton etc is able
en|to perform the same computational tasks given enough time and storage capacity a computer will
en|solve problems in exactly the way it is programmed to without regard to efficiency alternative
en|solutions possible shortcuts or possible errors in the code computer programs that learn and adapt
en|are part of the emerging field of artificial intelligence and machine learning artificial intelligence based
en|products generally fall into two major categories rule based systems and pattern recognition systems rule
en|based systems attempt to represent the rules used by human experts and tend to be
en|expensive to develop pattern based systems use data about a problem to generate conclusions examples
en|of pattern based systems include voice recognition font recognition translation and the emerging field of

en|w narcissism is a self centered personality style characterized as having an excessive preoccupation with
en|oneself and one s own needs often at the expense of others narcissism exists on
en|a continuum that ranges from normal to abnormal personality expression while many psychologists believe that
en|a moderate degree of narcissism is normal and healthy in humans there are also more
en|extreme forms observable particularly in people who are excessively self absorbed or who have a
en|mental illness like narcissistic personality disorder npd where the narcissistic tendency has become pathological leading
en|to functional impairment and psychosocial disability the term narcissism is derived from narcissus a character
en|in greek mythology best known from the telling in roman poet ovid s metamorphoses written
en|in ce book iii of the poem tells the mythical story of a handsome young
en|man narcissus who spurns the advances of many potential lovers when narcissus rejects the nymph
en|echo who was cursed to only echo the sounds that others made the gods punish
en|narcissus by making him fall in love with his own reflection in a pool of
en|water when narcissus discovers that the object of his love cannot love him back he
en|slowly pines away and dies the concept of excessive selfishness has been recognized throughout history
en|in ancient greece the concept was understood as hubris some religious movements such as the
en|hussites attempted to rectify what they viewed as the shattering and narcissistic cultures of recent
en|centuries it was not until the late s that narcissism began to be defined in
en|psychological terms since that time the term has had a significant divergence in meaning in
en|psychology it has been used to describe in psychiatrists paul n cke and havelock ellis
en|used the term narcissism independently of each other to describe a person who treats their
en|own body in the same way in which the body of a sexual partner is
en|ordinarily treated narcissism in this context was seen as a perversion that consumed a person
en|s entire sexual life in otto rank published the first clinical paper about narcissism linking
en|it to vanity and self admiration in an essay in called the god complex ernest
en|jones considered extreme narcissism as a character trait he described people with the god complex
en|as being aloof self important overconfident auto erotic inaccessible self admiring and exhibitionistic with fantasies
en|of omnipotence and omniscience he observed that these people had a high need for uniqueness
en|sigmund freud published his theory of narcissism in a lengthy essay titled on narcissism an
en|introduction for freud narcissism refers to the individual s direction of libidinal energy toward themselves
en|rather than objects and others he postulated a universal primary narcissism that was a phase
en|of sexual development in early infancy a necessary intermediate stage between auto eroticism and object
en|love love for others portions of this self love or ego libido are at later
en|stages of development expressed outwardly or given off toward others freud s postulation of a
en|secondary narcissism came as a result of his observation of the peculiar nature of the
en|schizophrenic s relation to themselves and the world he observed that the two fundamental qualities
en|of such patients were megalomania and withdrawal of interest from the real world of people
en|and things the libido that has been withdrawn from the external world has been directed
en|to the ego and thus gives rise to an attitude which may be called narcissism
en|it is a secondary narcissism because it is not a new creation but a magnification
en|of an already existing condition primary narcissism in robert waelder conceptualized narcissism as a personality
en|trait his definition described individuals who are condescending feel superior to others are preoccupied with
en|admiration and exhibit a lack of empathy waelder s work and his case study have
en|been influential in the way narcissism and the clinical disorder narcissistic personality disorder are defined
en|today citation needed his patient was a successful scientist with an attitude of superiority an
en|obsession with fostering self respect and a lack of normal feelings of guilt the patient
en|was aloof and independent from others had an inability to empathize with others and was
en|selfish sexually waelder s patient was also overly logical and analytical and valued abstract intellectual
en|thought over the practical application of scientific knowledge karen horney postulated that narcissism was on
en|a spectrum that ranged from healthy self esteem to a pathological state the term entered
en|the broader social consciousness following the publication of the culture of narcissism by christopher lasch
en|in since then social media bloggers and self help authors have indiscriminately applied narcissism as
en|a label for the self serving and for all domestic abusers some psychologists suggest that
en|a moderate level of narcissism is supportive of good psychological health self esteem works as
en|a mediator between narcissism and psychological health therefore because of their elevated self esteem deriving
en|from self perceptions of competence and likability high narcissists are relatively free of worry and
en|gloom while narcissism in and of itself can be considered a normal personality trait high
en|levels of narcissistic behavior can be harmful to both self and others destructive narcissism is
en|the constant exhibition of a few of the intense characteristics usually associated with pathological narcissistic
en|personality disorder such as a pervasive pattern of grandiosity which is characterized by feelings of
en|entitlement and superiority arrogant or haughty behaviors and a generalized lack of empathy and concern
en|for others on a spectrum destructive narcissism is more extreme than healthy narcissism but not
en|as extreme as the pathological condition extremely high levels of narcissistic behavior are considered pathological
en|the pathological condition of narcissism is a magnified extreme manifestation of healthy narcissism it manifests
en|itself in the inability to love others lack of empathy emptiness boredom and an unremitting
en|need to search for power while making the person unavailable to others the clinical theorists
en|kernberg kohut and theodore millon all saw pathological narcissism as a possible outcome in response
en|to unempathetic and inconsistent early childhood interactions they suggested that narcissists try to compensate in
en|adult relationships german psychoanalyst karen horney also saw the narcissistic personality as a temperament trait
en|molded by a certain kind of early environment heritability studies using twins have shown that
en|narcissistic traits as measured by standardized tests are often inherited narcissism was found to have
en|a high heritability score indicating that the concordance of this trait in the identical twins
en|was significantly influenced by genetics as compared to an environmental causation it has also been
en|shown that there is a continuum or spectrum of narcissistic traits ranging from normal to
en|a pathological personality furthermore evidence suggests that individual elements of narcissism have their own heritability
en|score for example intrapersonal grandiosity has a score of and interpersonal entitlement has a score
en|of while the genetic impact on narcissism levels is significant it is not the only
en|factor at play two primary expressions of narcissism have been identified grandiose thick skinned and
en|vulnerable thin skinned recent accounts posit that the core of narcissism is self centred antagonism
en|or entitled self importance namely selfishness entitlement lack of empathy and devaluation of others grandiosity
en|and vulnerability are seen as different expressions of this antagonistic core arising from individual differences
en|in the strength of the approach and avoidance motivational systems narcissistic grandiosity is thought to
en|arise from a combination of the antagonistic core with temperamental boldness defined by positive emotionality
en|social dominance reward seeking and risk taking grandiosity is defined in addition to antagonism by
en|a confident exhibitionistic and manipulative self regulatory style narcissistic vulnerability is thought to arise from
en|a combination of the antagonistic core with temperamental reactivity defined by negative emotionality social avoidance
en|passivity and marked proneness to rage vulnerability is defined in addition to antagonism by a
en|shy vindictive and needy self regulatory style sexual narcissism has been described as an egocentric
en|pattern of sexual behavior that involves an inflated sense of sexual ability or sexual entitlement
en|sometimes in the form of extramarital affairs this can be overcompensation for low self esteem
en|or an inability to sustain true intimacy while this behavioral pattern is believed to be
en|more common in men than in women it occurs in both males and females who
en|compensate for feelings of sexual inadequacy by becoming overly proud or obsessed with their masculinity
en|or femininity the controversial condition referred to as sexual addiction is believed by some experts
en|to be sexual narcissism or sexual compulsivity rather than an addictive behavior narcissistic parents often
en|see their children as extensions of themselves and encourage the children to act in ways
en|that support the parents emotional and self esteem needs due to their vulnerability children may
en|be significantly affected by this behavior to meet the parents needs the child may sacrifice
en|their own wants and feelings a child subjected to this type of parenting may struggle
en|in adulthood with their intimate relationships in extreme situations this parenting style can result in
en|estranged relationships with the children coupled with feelings of resentment and in some cases self
en|destructive tendencies origins of narcissism in children can often come from the social learning theory
en|the social learning theory proposes that social behavior is learned by observing and imitating others
en|behavior this suggests that children are anticipated to grow up to be narcissistic when their
en|parents overvalue them there is a compulsion of some professionals to constantly assert their competence

en|likely to rise to leadership but were more likely to emerge as leaders in situations
en|where they were not known such as in outside hires versus internal promotions paradoxically narcissism
en|can present as characteristics that facilitate an individual s rise to leadership and ultimately lead

en|general workforce for example individuals high in narcissism inventories are more likely to engage in
en|counterproductive behavior that harms organizations or other people in the workplace aggressive and counterproductive behaviors
en|tend to surface when self esteem is threatened individuals high in narcissism have fragile self
en|esteem and are easily threatened one study found that employees who are high in narcissism

en|of narcissism focuses on the individual collective narcissism asserts that one can have a similar
en|excessively high opinion of a group and that a group can function as a narcissistic
en|entity collective narcissism is related to ethnocentrism however ethnocentrism primarily focuses on self centeredness at
en|an ethnic or cultural level while collective narcissism is extended to any type of ingroup
en|beyond just cultures and ethnicities some commentators contend that the american populace has become increasingly
en|narcissistic since the end of world war ii according to sociologist charles derber people pursue
en|and compete for attention on an unprecedented scale the profusion of popular literature about listening
en|and managing those who talk constantly about themselves suggests its pervasiveness in everyday life the
en|growth of media phenomena such as reality tv programs and social media are generating a
en|new era of public narcissism also supporting the contention that american culture has become more
en|narcissistic is an analysis of us popular song lyrics between and this found a growth
en|in the use of first person singular pronouns reflecting a greater focus on the self
en|and also of references to antisocial behavior during the same period there was a diminution

en|and self esteem in american popular print media have experienced vast inflation since the late
en|s between and direct mentions of self esteem in leading us newspapers and magazines increased
en|by per cent while narcissism which had been almost non existent in the press during
en|the s was referred to over times between and similar patterns of change in cultural
en|production are observable in other western states for example a linguistic analysis of the largest
en|circulation norwegian newspaper found that the use of self focused and individualistic terms increased in
en|frequency by per cent between and while collectivist terms declined by per cent one study
en|looked at differences in advertising between an individualistic culture united states and a collectivist culture
en|south korea and found that in the us there was a greater tendency to stress
en|the distinctiveness and uniqueness of the person whereas advertising in south korean stressed the importance
en|of social conformity and harmony these cultural differences were greater than the effects of individual
en|differences within national cultures there has been an increased interest in narcissism and narcissistic personality
en|disorder npd in the last years there are areas of substantial debate that surround the
en|subject including this extent of the controversy was on public display in when the committee
en|on personality disorders for the th edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental
en|disorders recommended the removal of narcissistic personality from the manual a contentious three year debate
en|unfolded in the clinical community with one of the sharpest critics being john gunderson md
en|the person who led the dsm personality disorders committee for the th edition of the
en|manual cognition attention is the concentration of awareness on some phenomenon to the exclusion of
en|other stimuli it is a process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information
en|whether considered subjective or objective william james wrote that attention is the taking possession by
en|the mind in clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneously
en|possible objects or trains of thought focalization concentration of consciousness are of its essence attention
en|has also been described as the allocation of limited cognitive processing resources attention is manifested
en|by an attentional bottleneck in terms of the amount of data the brain can process
en|each second for example in human vision only less than of the visual input data
en|at around one megabyte per second can enter the bottleneck leading to inattentional blindness attention
en|remains a crucial area of investigation within education psychology neuroscience cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology areas
en|of active investigation involve determining the source of the sensory cues and signals that generate
en|attention the effects of these sensory cues and signals on the tuning properties of sensory
en|neurons and the relationship between attention and other behavioral and cognitive processes which may include
en|working memory and psychological vigilance a relatively new body of research which expands upon earlier
en|research within psychopathology is investigating the diagnostic symptoms associated with traumatic brain injury and its
en|effects on attention attention also varies across cultures the relationships between attention and consciousness are
en|complex enough that they have warranted philosophical exploration such exploration is both ancient and continually
en|relevant as it can have effects in fields ranging from mental health and the study
en|of disorders of consciousness to artificial intelligence and its domains of research prior to the
en|founding of psychology as a scientific discipline attention was studied in the field of philosophy
en|thus many of the discoveries in the field of attention were made by philosophers psychologist
en|john b watson calls juan luis vives the father of modern psychology because in his
en|book de anima et vita the soul and life he was the first to recognize
en|the importance of empirical investigation in his work on memory vives found that the more
en|closely one attends to stimuli the better they will be retained by the s psychologists
en|began using positron emission tomography pet and later functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri to image
en|the brain while monitoring tasks involving attention considering this expensive equipment was generally only available
en|in hospitals psychologists sought cooperation with neurologists psychologist michael posner then already renowned for his
en|influential work on visual selective attention and neurologist marcus raichle pioneered brain imaging studies of
en|selective attention their results soon sparked interest from the neuroscience community which until then had
en|simply been focused on monkey brains with the development of these technological innovations neuroscientists became
en|interested in this type of research that combines sophisticated experimental paradigms from cognitive psychology with
en|these new brain imaging techniques although the older technique of electroencephalography eeg had long been
en|used to study the brain activity underlying selective attention by cognitive psychophysiologists the ability of
en|the newer techniques to actually measure precisely localized activity inside the brain generated renewed interest
en|by a wider community of researchers a growing body of such neuroimaging research has identified
en|a frontoparietal attention network which appears to be responsible for control of attention a definition
en|of a psychological construct forms a research approach to its study in scientific works attention
en|often coincides and substitutes the notion of intentionality due to the extent of semantic uncertainty
en|in the linguistic explanations of these notions definitions intentionality has in turn been defined as
en|the power of minds to be about something to represent or to stand for things
en|properties and states of affairs although these two psychological constructs attention and intentionality appear to
en|be defined by similar terms they are different notions to clarify the definition of attention
en|it would be correct to consider the origin of this notion to review the meaning
en|of the term given to it when the experimental study on attention was initiated it
en|is thought that the experimental approach began with famous experiments with a x matrix of
en|sixteen randomly chosen letters the experimental paradigm that informed wundt s theory of attention wundt
en|interpreted the experimental outcome introducing the meaning of attention as that psychical process which is
en|operative in the clear perception of the narrow region of the content of consciousness these
en|experiments showed the physical limits of attention threshold which were letters observing the matrix during
en|s of their exposition we shall call the entrance into the large region of consciousness
en|apprehension and the elevation into the focus of attention apperception wundt s theory of attention
en|postulated one of the main features of this notion that attention is an active voluntary
en|process realized during a certain time in contrast neuroscience research shows that intentionality may emerge
en|instantly even unconsciously research reported to register neuronal correlates of an intentional act that preceded
en|this conscious act also see shared intentionality therefore while intentionality is a mental state the
en|power of the mind to be about something arising even unconsciously the description of the
en|construct of attention should be understood in the dynamical sense as the ability to elevate
en|the clear perception of the narrow region of the content of consciousness and to keep
en|in mind this state for a time the attention threshold would be the period of
en|minimum time needed for employing perception to clearly apprehend the scope of intention from this
en|perspective a scientific approach to attention is relevant when it considers the difference between these
en|two concepts first of all between their statical and dynamical statuses the growing body of
en|literature shows empirical evidence that attention is conditioned by the number of elements and the
en|duration of exposition decades of research on subitizing have supported wundt s findings about the
en|limits of a human ability to concentrate awareness on a task a significant inference from
en|the wundtian approach to the study of attention the scope of attention is related to
en|cognitive development as the mind grasps more details about an event it also increases the
en|number of reasonable combinations within that event enhancing the probability of better understanding its features
en|and particularity for example three items in the focal point of consciousness have six possible
en|combinations factorial and four items have factorial combinations this number of combinations becomes significantly prominent
en|in the case of a focal point with six items with possible combinations factorial empirical
en|evidence suggests that the scope of attention in young children develops from two items in
en|the focal point at age up to six months to five or more items in
en|the focal point at age about five years in cognitive psychology there are at least
en|two models which describe how visual attention operates these models may be considered metaphors which
en|are used to describe internal processes and to generate hypotheses that are falsifiable generally speaking
en|visual attention is thought to operate as a two stage process in the first stage
en|attention is distributed uniformly over the external visual scene and processing of information is performed
en|in parallel in the second stage attention is concentrated to a specific area of the
en|visual scene i e it is focused and processing is performed in a serial fashion
en|the first of these models to appear in the literature is the spotlight model the
en|term spotlight was inspired by the work of william james who described attention as having
en|a focus a margin and a fringe the focus is an area that extracts information
en|from the visual scene with a high resolution the geometric center of which being where
en|visual attention is directed surrounding the focus is the fringe of attention which extracts information
en|in a much more crude fashion i e low resolution this fringe extends out to
en|a specified area and the cut off is called the margin the second model is
en|called the zoom lens model and was first introduced in this model inherits all properties
en|of the spotlight model i e the focus the fringe and the margin but it
en|has the added property of changing in size this size change mechanism was inspired by
en|the zoom lens one might find on a camera and any change in size can
en|be described by a trade off in the efficiency of processing the zoom lens of
en|attention can be described in terms of an inverse trade off between the size of
en|focus and the efficiency of processing because attention resources are assumed to be fixed then
en|it follows that the larger the focus is the slower processing will be of that
en|region of the visual scene since this fixed resource will be distributed over a larger
en|area it is thought that the focus of attention can subtend a minimum of of
en|visual angle however the maximum size has not yet been determined a significant debate emerged
en|in the last decade of the th century in which treisman s feature integration theory
en|fit was compared to duncan and humphrey s attentional engagement theory aet â€Š â€Š fit
en|posits that objects are retrieved from scenes by means of selective spatial attention that picks
en|out objects features forms feature maps and integrates those features that are found at the
en|same location into forming objects treismans s theory is based on a two stage process
en|to help solve the binding problem of attention these two stages are the preattentive stage
en|and the focused attention stage through sequencing these steps parallel and serial search is better
en|exhibited through the formation of conjunctions of objects conjunctive searches according to treismans are done
en|through both stages in order to create selective and focused attention on an object though
en|duncan and humphrey would disagree duncan and humphrey s aet understanding of attention maintained that
en|there is an initial pre attentive parallel phase of perceptual segmentation and analysis that encompasses
en|all of the visual items present in a scene at this phase descriptions of the
en|objects in a visual scene are generated into structural units the outcome of this parallel
en|phase is a multiple spatial scale structured representation selective attention intervenes after this stage to
en|select information that will be entered into visual short term memory â€Š â€Š the contrast
en|of the two theories placed a new emphasis on the separation of visual attention tasks
en|alone and those mediated by supplementary cognitive processes as rastophopoulos summarizes the debate against treisman
en|s fit which posits spatial attention as a necessary condition for detection of objects humphreys
en|argues that visual elements are encoded and bound together in an initial parallel phase without
en|focal attention and that attention serves to select among the objects that result from this
en|initial grouping â€Š â€Š in the twentieth century the pioneering research of lev vygotsky and
en|alexander luria led to the three part model of neuropsychology defining the working brain as
en|being represented by three co active processes listed as attention memory and activation a r
en|luria published his well known book the working brain in as a concise adjunct volume
en|to his previous book higher cortical functions in man in this volume luria summarized his
en|three part global theory of the working brain as being composed of three constantly co
en|active processes which he described as the attention system mnestic memory system and cortical activation
en|system the two books together are considered by homskaya s account as among luria s
en|major works in neuropsychology most fully reflecting all the aspects theoretical clinical experimental of this
en|new discipline the product of the combined research of vygotsky and luria have determined a
en|large part of the contemporary understanding and definition of attention as it is understood at
en|the start of the st century multitasking can be defined as the attempt to perform
en|two or more tasks simultaneously however research shows that when multitasking people make more mistakes
en|or perform their tasks more slowly attention must be divided among all of the component
en|tasks to perform them in divided attention individuals attend or give attention to multiple sources
en|of information at once or perform more than one task at the same time older
en|research involved looking at the limits of people performing simultaneous tasks like reading stories while
en|listening and writing something else or listening to two separate messages through different ears i
en|e dichotic listening generally classical research into attention investigated the ability of people to learn
en|new information when there were multiple tasks to be performed or to probe the limits
en|of our perception c f donald broadbent there is also older literature on people s
en|performance on multiple tasks performed simultaneously such as driving a car while tuning a radio
en|or driving while being on the phone the vast majority of current research on human
en|multitasking is based on performance of doing two tasks simultaneously usually that involves driving while
en|performing another task such as texting eating or even speaking to passengers in the vehicle
en|or with a friend over a cellphone this research reveals that the human attentional system
en|has limits for what it can process driving performance is worse while engaged in other
en|tasks drivers make more mistakes brake harder and later get into more accidents veer into
en|other lanes and or are less aware of their surroundings when engaged in the previously
en|discussed tasks there has been little difference found between speaking on a hands free cell
en|phone or a hand held cell phone which suggests that it is the strain of
en|attentional system that causes problems rather than what the driver is doing with his or
en|her hands while speaking with a passenger is as cognitively demanding as speaking with a
en|friend over the phone passengers are able to change the conversation based upon the needs
en|of the driver for example if traffic intensifies a passenger may stop talking to allow
en|the driver to navigate the increasingly difficult roadway a conversation partner over a phone would
en|not be aware of the change in environment there have been multiple theories regarding divided
en|attention one conceived by kahneman explains that there is a single pool of attentional resources
en|that can be freely divided among multiple tasks this model seems oversimplified however due to
en|the different modalities e g visual auditory verbal that are perceived when the two simultaneous
en|tasks use the same modality such as listening to a radio station and writing a
en|paper it is much more difficult to concentrate on both because the tasks are likely
en|to interfere with each other the specific modality model was theorized by navon and gopher
en|in however more recent research using well controlled dual task paradigms points at the importance
en|of tasks as an alternative resource theory has been proposed as a more accurate metaphor
en|for explaining divided attention on complex tasks resource theory states that as each complex task
en|is automatized performing that task requires less of the individual s limited capacity attentional resources
en|other variables play a part in our ability to pay attention to and concentrate on
en|many tasks at once these include but are not limited to anxiety arousal task difficulty
en|and skills simultaneous attention is a type of attention classified by attending to multiple events
en|at the same time simultaneous attention is demonstrated by children in indigenous communities who learn
en|through this type of attention to their surroundings simultaneous attention is present in the ways
en|in which children of indigenous backgrounds interact both with their surroundings and with other individuals
en|simultaneous attention requires focus on multiple simultaneous activities or occurrences this differs from multitasking which
en|is characterized by alternating attention and focus between multiple activities or halting one activity before
en|switching to the next simultaneous attention involves uninterrupted attention to several activities occurring at the
en|same time another cultural practice that may relate to simultaneous attention strategies is coordination within
en|a group indigenous heritage toddlers and caregivers in san pedro were observed to frequently coordinate
en|their activities with other members of a group in ways parallel to a model of
en|simultaneous attention whereas middle class european descent families in the u s would move back
en|and forth between events research concludes that children with close ties to indigenous american roots
en|have a high tendency to be especially wide keen observers this points to a strong
en|cultural difference in attention management attention may be differentiated into overt versus covert orienting overt
en|orienting is the act of selectively attending to an item or location over others by
en|moving the eyes to point in that direction overt orienting can be directly observed in
en|the form of eye movements although overt eye movements are quite common there is a
en|distinction that can be made between two types of eye movements reflexive and controlled reflexive
en|movements are commanded by the superior colliculus of the midbrain these movements are fast and
en|are activated by the sudden appearance of stimuli in contrast controlled eye movements are commanded
en|by areas in the frontal lobe these movements are slow and voluntary covert orienting is
en|the act of mentally shifting one s focus without moving one s eyes simply it
en|is changes in attention that are not attributable to overt eye movements covert orienting has
en|the potential to affect the output of perceptual processes by governing attention to particular items
en|or locations for example the activity of a v neuron whose receptive field lies on
en|an attended stimuli will be enhanced by covert attention but does not influence the information
en|that is processed by the senses researchers often use filtering tasks to study the role
en|of covert attention of selecting information these tasks often require participants to observe a number
en|of stimuli but attend to only one the current view is that visual covert attention
en|is a mechanism for quickly scanning the field of view for interesting locations this shift
en|in covert attention is linked to eye movement circuitry that sets up a slower saccade
en|to that location there are studies that suggest the mechanisms of overt and covert orienting
en|may not be controlled separately and independently as previously believed central mechanisms that may control
en|covert orienting such as the parietal lobe also receive input from subcortical centres involved in
en|overt orienting in support of this general theories of attention actively assume bottom up reflexive
en|processes and top down voluntary processes converge on a common neural architecture in that they
en|control both covert and overt attentional systems for example if individuals attend to the right
en|hand corner field of view movement of the eyes in that direction may have to
en|be actively suppressed covert attention has been argued to reflect the existence of processes programming
en|explicit ocular movement however this has been questioned on the grounds that n a neural
en|measure of covert attentional allocation does not always precede eye movements however the researchers acknowledge
en|it may be impossible to definitively rule out the possibility that some kind of shift
en|of covert attention precedes every shift of overt attention orienting attention is vital and can
en|be controlled through external exogenous or internal endogenous processes however comparing these two processes is
en|challenging because external signals do not operate completely exogenously but will only summon attention and
en|eye movements if they are important to the subject exogenous from greek exo meaning outside
en|and genein meaning to produce orienting is frequently described as being under control of a
en|stimulus exogenous orienting is considered to be reflexive and automatic and is caused by a
en|sudden change in the periphery this often results in a reflexive saccade since exogenous cues
en|are typically presented in the periphery they are referred to as peripheral cues exogenous orienting
en|can even be observed when individuals are aware that the cue will not relay reliable
en|accurate information about where a target is going to occur this means that the mere
en|presence of an exogenous cue will affect the response to other stimuli that are subsequently
en|presented in the cue s previous location several studies have investigated the influence of valid
en|and invalid cues they concluded that valid peripheral cues benefit performance for instance when the
en|peripheral cues are brief flashes at the relevant location before the onset of a visual
en|stimulus posner and cohen noted a reversal of this benefit takes place when the interval
en|between the onset of the cue and the onset of the target is longer than
en|about ms the phenomenon of valid cues producing longer reaction times than invalid cues is
en|called inhibition of return endogenous from greek endo meaning within or internally orienting is the
en|intentional allocation of attentional resources to a predetermined location or space simply stated endogenous orienting
en|occurs when attention is oriented according to an observer s goals or desires allowing the
en|focus of attention to be manipulated by the demands of a task in order to
en|have an effect endogenous cues must be processed by the observer and acted upon purposefully
en|these cues are frequently referred to as central cues this is because they are typically
en|presented at the center of a display where an observer s eyes are likely to
en|be fixated central cues such as an arrow or digit presented at fixation tell observers
en|to attend to a specific location when examining differences between exogenous and endogenous orienting some
en|researchers suggest that there are four differences between the two kinds of cues there exist
en|both overlaps and differences in the areas of the brain that are responsible for endogenous
en|and exogenous orientating another approach to this discussion has been covered under the topic heading
en|of bottom up versus top down orientations to attention researchers of this school have described
en|two different aspects of how the mind focuses attention to items present in the environment
en|the first aspect is called bottom up processing also known as stimulus driven attention or
en|exogenous attention these describe attentional processing which is driven by the properties of the objects
en|themselves some processes such as motion or a sudden loud noise can attract our attention
en|in a pre conscious or non volitional way we attend to them whether we want
en|to or not these aspects of attention are thought to involve parietal and temporal cortices
en|as well as the brainstem more recent experimental evidence support the idea that the primary
en|visual cortex creates a bottom up saliency map which is received by the superior colliculus
en|in the midbrain area to guide attention or gaze shifts the second aspect is called
en|top down processing also known as goal driven endogenous attention attentional control or executive attention
en|this aspect of our attentional orienting is under the control of the person who is
en|attending it is mediated primarily by the frontal cortex and basal ganglia as one of
en|the executive functions research has shown that it is related to other aspects of the
en|executive functions such as working memory and conflict resolution and inhibition a hugely influential theory
en|regarding selective attention is the perceptual load theory which states that there are two mechanisms
en|that affect attention cognitive and perceptual the perceptual considers the subject s ability to perceive
en|or ignore stimuli both task related and non task related studies show that if there
en|are many stimuli present especially if they are task related it is much easier to
en|ignore the non task related stimuli but if there are few stimuli the mind will
en|perceive the irrelevant stimuli as well as the relevant the cognitive refers to the actual
en|processing of the stimuli studies regarding this showed that the ability to process stimuli decreased
en|with age meaning that younger people were able to perceive more stimuli and fully process
en|them but were likely to process both relevant and irrelevant information while older people could
en|process fewer stimuli but usually processed only relevant information some people can process multiple stimuli
en|e g trained morse code operators have been able to copy of a message while
en|carrying on a meaningful conversation this relies on the reflexive response due to overlearning the
en|skill of morse code reception detection transcription so that it is an autonomous function requiring
en|no specific attention to perform this overtraining of the brain comes as the practice of
en|a skill surpasses accuracy allowing the activity to become autonomic while your mind has room
en|to process other actions simultaneously based on the primary role of the perceptual load theory
en|assumptions regarding its functionality surrounding that attentional resources are that of limited capacity which signify
en|the need for all of the attentional resources to be used this performance however is
en|halted when put hand in hand with accuracy and reaction time rt this limitation arises
en|through the measurement of literature when obtaining outcomes for scores this affects both cognitive and
en|perceptual attention because there is a lack of measurement surrounding distributions of temporal and spatial
en|attention only a concentrated amount of attention on how effective one is completing the task
en|and how long they take is being analyzed making a more redundant analysis on overall
en|cognition of being able to process multiple stimuli through perception attention is best described as
en|the sustained focus of cognitive resources on information while filtering or ignoring extraneous information attention
en|is a very basic function that often is a precursor to all other neurological cognitive
en|functions as is frequently the case clinical models of attention differ from investigation models one
en|of the most used models for the evaluation of attention in patients with very different
en|neurologic pathologies is the model of sohlberg and mateer this hierarchic model is based in
en|the recovering of attention processes of brain damage patients after coma five different kinds of
en|activities of growing difficulty are described in the model connecting with the activities those patients
en|could do as their recovering process advanced this model has been shown to be very
en|useful in evaluating attention in very different pathologies correlates strongly with daily difficulties and is
en|especially helpful in designing stimulation programs such as attention process training a rehabilitation program for
en|neurological patients of the same authors most experiments show that one neural correlate of attention
en|is enhanced firing if a neuron has a different response to a stimulus when an
en|animal is not attending to a stimulus versus when the animal does attend to the
en|stimulus then the neuron s response will be enhanced even if the physical characteristics of
en|the stimulus remain the same in a review knudsen describes a more general model which
en|identifies four core processes of attention with working memory at the center neurally at different
en|hierarchical levels spatial maps can enhance or inhibit activity in sensory areas and induce orienting
en|behaviors like eye movement in many cases attention produces changes in the eeg many animals
en|including humans produce gamma waves Â hz when focusing attention on a particular object or
en|activity another commonly used model for the attention system has been put forth by researchers
en|such as michael posner he divides attention into three functional components alerting orienting and executive
en|attention that can also interact and influence each other children appear to develop patterns of
en|attention related to the cultural practices of their families communities and the institutions in which
en|they participate in jules henry suggested that there are societal differences in sensitivity to signals
en|from many ongoing sources that call for the awareness of several levels of attention simultaneously
en|he tied his speculation to ethnographic observations of communities in which children are involved in
en|a complex social community with multiple relationships many indigenous children in the americas predominantly learn
en|by observing and pitching in there are several studies to support that the use of
en|keen attention towards learning is much more common in indigenous communities of north and central
en|america than in a middle class european american setting this is a direct result of
en|the learning by observing and pitching in model keen attention is both a requirement and
en|result of learning by observing and pitching in incorporating the children in the community gives
en|them the opportunity to keenly observe and contribute to activities that were not directed towards
en|them it can be seen from different indigenous communities and cultures such as the mayans
en|of san pedro that children can simultaneously attend to multiple events most maya children have
en|learned to pay attention to several events at once in order to make useful observations
en|one example is simultaneous attention which involves uninterrupted attention to several activities occurring at the
en|same time another cultural practice that may relate to simultaneous attention strategies is coordination within
en|a group san pedro toddlers and caregivers frequently coordinated their activities with other members of
en|a group in multiway engagements rather than in a dyadic fashion research concludes that children
en|with close ties to indigenous american roots have a high tendency to be especially keen
en|observers this learning by observing and pitching in model requires active levels of attention management
en|the child is present while caretakers engage in daily activities and responsibilities such as weaving
en|farming and other skills necessary for survival being present allows the child to focus their
en|attention on the actions being performed by their parents elders and or older siblings in
en|order to learn in this way keen attention and focus is required eventually the child
en|is expected to be able to perform these skills themselves in the domain of computer
en|vision efforts have been made to model the mechanism of human attention especially the bottom
en|up intentional mechanism and its semantic significance in classification of video contents both spatial attention
en|and temporal attention have been incorporated in such classification efforts generally speaking there are two
en|kinds of models to mimic the bottom up salience mechanism in static images one way
en|is based on the spatial contrast analysis for example a center surround mechanism has been
en|used to define salience across scales inspired by the putative neural mechanism it has also
en|been hypothesized that some visual inputs are intrinsically salient in certain background contexts and that
en|these are actually task independent this model has established itself as the exemplar for salience
en|detection and consistently used for comparison in the literature the other way is based on
en|the frequency domain analysis this method was first proposed by hou et al this method
en|was called sr then the pqft method was also introduced both sr and pqft only
en|use the phase information in the hft method was introduced and both the amplitude and
en|the phase information are made use of the neural abstraction pyramid is a hierarchical recurrent
en|convolutional model which incorporates bottom up and top down flow of information to iteratively interpret
en|images hemispatial neglect also called unilateral neglect often occurs when people have damage to their
en|right hemisphere this damage often leads to a tendency to ignore the left side of
en|one s body or even the left side of an object that can be seen
en|damage to the left side of the brain the left hemisphere rarely yields significant neglect
en|of the right side of the body or object in the person s local environments
en|the effects of spatial neglect however may vary and differ depending on what area of
en|the brain was damaged damage to different neural substrates can result in different types of
en|neglect attention disorders lateralized and nonlaterized may also contribute to the symptoms and effects much
en|research has asserted that damage to gray matter within the brain results in spatial neglect
en|new technology has yielded more information such that there is a large distributed network of
en|frontal parietal temporal and subcortical brain areas that have been tied to neglect this network
en|can be related to other research as well the dorsal attention network is tied to
en|spatial orienting the effect of damage to this network may result in patients neglecting their
en|left side when distracted about their right side or an object on their right side
en|social attention is one special form of attention that involves the allocation of limited processing
en|resources in a social context previous studies on social attention often regard how attention is
en|directed toward socially relevant stimuli such as faces and gaze directions of other individuals in
en|contrast to attending to others a different line of researches has shown that self related
en|information such as own face and name automatically captures attention and is preferentially processed comparing
en|to other related information these contrasting effects between attending to others and attending to self
en|prompt a synthetic view in a recent opinion article proposing that social attention operates at
en|two polarizing states in one extreme individual tends to attend to the self and prioritize
en|self related information over others and in the other extreme attention is allocated to other
en|individuals to infer their intentions and desires attending to self and attending to others mark
en|the two ends of an otherwise continuum spectrum of social attention for a given behavioral
en|context the mechanisms underlying these two polarities might interact and compete with each other in
en|order to determine a saliency map of social attention that guides our behaviors an imbalanced
en|competition between these two behavioral and cognitive processes will cause cognitive disorders and neurological symptoms
en|such as autism spectrum disorders and williams syndrome according to daniel goleman s book focus
en|the hidden driver of excellence there are two types of distracting factors affecting focus sensory
en|and emotional a sensory distracting factor would be for example while a person is reading
en|this article they are neglecting the white field surrounding the text an emotional distracting factor
en|would be when someone is focused on answering an email and somebody shouts their name
en|it would be almost impossible to neglect the voice speaking it attention is immediately directed
en|toward the source positive emotions have also been found to affect attention induction of happiness
en|has led to increased response times and an increase in inaccurate responses in the face
en|of irrelevant stimuli two possible theories as to why emotions might make one more susceptible
en|to distracting stimuli is that emotions take up too much of one s cognitive resources
en|and make it harder to control your focus of attention the other theory is that
en|emotions make it harder to filter out distractions specifically with positive emotions due to a
en|feeling of security another distracting factor to attention processes is insufficient sleep sleep deprivation is
en|found to impair cognition specifically performance in divided attention divided attention is possibly linked with
en|the circadian processes inattentional blindness was first introduced in by arien mack and irvic rock
en|their studies show that when people are focused on specific stimuli they often miss other
en|stimuli that are clearly present though actual blindness is not occurring here the blindness that
en|happens is due to the perceptual load of what is being attended to based on
en|the experiment performed by mack and rock ula finch and nilli lavie tested participants with
en|a perceptual task they presented subjects with a cross one arm being longer than the
en|other for trials on the sixth trial a white square was added to the top
en|left of the screen the results conclude that out of participants only actually saw the
en|square this would suggest that when a higher focus was attended to the length of
en|the crossed arms the more likely someone would altogether miss an object that was in
en|plain sight change blindness was first tested by rensink and coworkers in their studies show
en|that people have difficulty detecting changes from scene to scene due to the intense focus
en|on one thing or lack of attention overall this was tested by rensink through a
en|presentation of a picture and then a blank field and then the same picture but
en|with an item missing the results showed that the pictures had to be alternated back
en|and forth a good number of times for participants to notice the difference this idea
en|is greatly portrayed in films that have continuity errors many people do not pick up
en|on differences when in reality the changes tend to be significant psychologist daniel e berlyne
en|credits the first extended treatment of attention to philosopher nicolas malebranche in his work the
en|search after truth malebranche held that we have access to ideas or mental representations of
en|the external world but not direct access to the world itself thus in order to
en|keep these ideas organized attention is necessary otherwise we will confuse these ideas malebranche writes
en|in the search after truth because it often happens that the understanding has only confused
en|and imperfect perceptions of things it is truly a cause of our errors it is
en|therefore necessary to look for means to keep our perceptions from being confused and imperfect
en|and because as everyone knows there is nothing that makes them clearer and more distinct
en|than attentiveness we must try to find the means to become more attentive than we
en|are according to malebranche attention is crucial to understanding and keeping thoughts organized philosopher gottfried
en|wilhelm leibniz introduced the concept of apperception to this philosophical approach to attention apperception refers
en|to the process by which new experience is assimilated to and transformed by the residuum
en|of past experience of an individual to form a new whole apperception is required for
en|a perceived event to become a conscious event leibniz emphasized a reflexive involuntary view of
en|attention known as exogenous orienting however there is also endogenous orienting which is voluntary and
en|directed attention philosopher johann friedrich herbart agreed with leibniz s view of apperception however he
en|expounded on it in by saying that new experiences had to be tied to ones
en|already existing in the mind herbart was also the first person to stress the importance
en|of applying mathematical modeling to the study of psychology throughout the philosophical era various thinkers
en|made significant contributions to the field of attention studies beginning with research on the extent
en|of attention and how attention is directed in the beginning of the th century it
en|was thought that people were not able to attend to more than one stimulus at
en|a time however with research contributions by sir william hamilton th baronet this view was
en|changed hamilton proposed a view of attention that likened its capacity to holding marbles you
en|can only hold a certain number of marbles at a time before it starts to
en|spill over his view states that we can attend to more than one stimulus at
en|once william stanley jevons later expanded this view and stated that we can attend to
en|up to four items at a time this period of attention research took the focus
en|from conceptual findings to experimental testing it also involved psychophysical methods that allowed measurement of
en|the relation between physical stimulus properties and the psychological perceptions of them this period covers
en|the development of attentional research from the founding of psychology to wilhelm wundt introduced the
en|study of attention to the field of psychology wundt measured mental processing speed by likening
en|it to differences in stargazing measurements astronomers in this time would measure the time it
en|took for stars to travel among these measurements when astronomers recorded the times there were
en|personal differences in calculation these different readings resulted in different reports from each astronomer to
en|correct for this a personal equation was developed wundt applied this to mental processing speed
en|wundt realized that the time it takes to see the stimulus of the star and
en|write down the time was being called an observation error but actually was the time
en|it takes to switch voluntarily one s attention from one stimulus to another wundt called
en|his school of psychology voluntarism it was his belief that psychological processes can only be
en|understood in terms of goals and consequences franciscus donders used mental chronometry to study attention
en|and it was considered a major field of intellectual inquiry by authors such as sigmund
en|freud donders and his students conducted the first detailed investigations of the speed of mental
en|processes donders measured the time required to identify a stimulus and to select a motor
en|response this was the time difference between stimulus discrimination and response initiation donders also formalized
en|the subtractive method which states that the time for a particular process can be estimated
en|by adding that process to a task and taking the difference in reaction time between
en|the two tasks he also differentiated between three types of reactions simple reaction choice reaction
en|and go no go reaction hermann von helmholtz also contributed to the field of attention
en|relating to the extent of attention von helmholtz stated that it is possible to focus
en|on one stimulus and still perceive or ignore others an example of this is being
en|able to focus on the letter u in the word house and still perceiving the
en|letters h o s and e one major debate in this period was whether it
en|was possible to attend to two things at once split attention walter benjamin described this
en|experience as reception in a state of distraction this disagreement could only be resolved through
en|experimentation in william james in his textbook the principles of psychology remarked everyone knows what
en|attention is it is the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form
en|of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought focalization
en|concentration of consciousness are of its essence it implies withdrawal from some things in order
en|to deal effectively with others and is a condition which has a real opposite in
en|the confused dazed scatterbrained state which in french is called distraction and zerstreutheit in german
en|james differentiated between sensorial attention and intellectual attention sensorial attention is when attention is directed
en|to objects of sense stimuli that are physically present intellectual attention is attention directed to
en|ideal or represented objects stimuli that are not physically present james also distinguished between immediate
en|or derived attention attention to the present versus to something not physically present according to
en|james attention has five major effects attention works to make us perceive conceive distinguish remember
en|and shorten reactions time during this period research in attention waned and interest in behaviorism
en|flourished leading some to believe like ulric neisser that in this period there was no
en|research on attention however jersild published very important work on mental set and shift in
en|he stated the fact of mental set is primary in all conscious activity the same
en|stimulus may evoke any one of a large number of responses depending upon the contextual
en|setting in which it is placed this research found that the time to complete a
en|list was longer for mixed lists than for pure lists for example if a list
en|was names of animals versus a list of the same size with names of animals
en|books makes and models of cars and types of fruits it takes longer to process
en|the second list this is task switching in telford discovered the psychological refractory period the
en|stimulation of neurons is followed by a refractory phase during which neurons are less sensitive
en|to stimulation in john ridley stroop developed the stroop task which elicited the stroop effect
en|stroop s task showed that irrelevant stimulus information can have a major impact on performance
en|in this task subjects were to look at a list of colors this list of
en|colors had each color typed in a color different from the actual text for example
en|the word blue would be typed in orange pink in black and so on example
en|blue purple red green purple green subjects were then instructed to say the name of
en|the ink color and ignore the text it took seconds to complete a list of
en|this type compared to seconds to name the colors when presented in the form of
en|solid squares the naming time nearly doubled in the presence of conflicting color words an
en|effect known as the stroop effect in the s research psychologists renewed their interest in
en|attention when the dominant epistemology shifted from positivism i e behaviorism to realism during what
en|has come to be known as the cognitive revolution the cognitive revolution admitted unobservable cognitive
en|processes like attention as legitimate objects of scientific study modern research on attention began with
en|the analysis of the cocktail party problem by colin cherry in at a cocktail party
en|how do people select the conversation that they are listening to and ignore the rest
en|this problem is at times called focused attention as opposed to divided attention cherry performed
en|a number of experiments which became known as dichotic listening and were extended by donald
en|broadbent and others â€Š â€Š in a typical experiment subjects would use a set of
en|headphones to listen to two streams of words in different ears and selectively attend to
en|one stream after the task the experimenter would question the subjects about the content of
en|the unattended stream broadbent s filter model of attention states that information is held in
en|a pre attentive temporary store and only sensory events that have some physical feature in
en|common are selected to pass into the limited capacity processing system this implies that the
en|meaning of unattended messages is not identified also a significant amount of time is required
en|to shift the filter from one channel to another experiments by gray and wedderburn and
en|later anne treisman pointed out various problems in broadbent s early model and eventually led
en|to the deutsch norman model in in this model no signal is filtered out but
en|all are processed to the point of activating their stored representations in memory the point
en|at which attention becomes selective is when one of the memory representations is selected for
en|further processing at any time only one can be selected resulting in the attentional bottleneck
en|â€Š â€Š this debate became known as the early selection vs late selection models in
en|the early selection models first proposed by donald broadbent attention shuts down in broadbent s
en|model or attenuates in treisman s refinement processing in the unattended ear before the mind
en|can analyze its semantic content in the late selection models first proposed by j anthony
en|deutsch and diana deutsch the content in both ears is analyzed semantically but the words
en|in the unattended ear cannot access consciousness lavie s perceptual load theory however provided elegant

en|involves both sacred and secular use and is usually based on small scale cultivation the
en|use of the plant for cordage clothing medicine food and a general use as an
en|euphoriant and symbol of fellowship the second stream of expansion of cannabis use encompasses the
en|use of hemp for commercial manufacturers utilizing large scale cultivation primarily as a fiber for
en|mercantile purposes but it is also linked to the search for psychedelic experiences which can
en|be traced back to the formation of the parisian club des hashischins since the beginning
en|of the th century most countries have enacted laws against the cultivation possession or transfer
en|of cannabis these laws have had an adverse effect on cannabis cultivation for non recreational
en|purposes but there are many regions where handling of cannabis is legal or licensed many
en|jurisdictions have lessened the penalties for possession of small quantities of cannabis so that it
en|is punished by confiscation and sometimes a fine rather than imprisonment focusing more on those
en|who traffic the drug on the black market in some areas where cannabis use had
en|been historically tolerated new restrictions were instituted such as the closing of cannabis coffee shops

en|users in the scottish crime and justice survey used cannabis the gateway effect may appear
en|due to social factors involved in using any illegal drug because of the illegal status
en|of cannabis its consumers are likely to find themselves in situations allowing them to acquaint
en|with individuals using or selling other illegal drugs studies have shown that alcohol and tobacco
en|may additionally be regarded as gateway drugs however a more parsimonious explanation could be that
en|cannabis is simply more readily available and at an earlier age than illegal hard drugs
en|citation needed in turn alcohol and tobacco are typically easier to obtain at an earlier
en|age than is cannabis though the reverse may be true in some areas thus leading
en|to the gateway sequence in those individuals since they are most likely to experiment with
en|any drug offered a related alternative to the gateway hypothesis is the common liability to
en|addiction cla theory it states that some individuals are for various reasons willing to try
en|multiple recreational substances the gateway drugs are merely those that are usually available at an
en|earlier age than the harder drugs researchers have noted in an extensive review that it
en|is dangerous to present the sequence of events described in gateway theory in causative terms
en|as this hinders both research and intervention in the national institute on drug abuse released
en|a study backing allegations that marijuana is a gateway to harder drugs though not for
en|the majority of marijuana users the national institute on drug abuse determined that marijuana use
en|is likely to precede use of other licit and illicit substances and that adults who
en|reported marijuana use during the first wave of the survey were more likely than adults
en|who did not use marijuana to develop an alcohol use disorder within years people who
en|used marijuana and already had an alcohol use disorder at the outset were at greater
en|risk of their alcohol use disorder worsening marijuana use is also linked to other substance
en|use disorders including nicotine addiction it also reported that these findings are consistent with the
en|idea of marijuana as a gateway drug however the majority of people who use marijuana
en|do not go on to use other harder substances also cross sensitization is not unique
en|to marijuana alcohol and nicotine also prime the brain for a heightened response to other
en|drugs and are like marijuana also typically used before a person progresses to other more
en|harmful substances research on cannabis is challenging since the plant is illegal in most countries
en|research grade samples of the drug are difficult to obtain for research purposes unless granted
en|under authority of national regulatory agencies such as the us food and drug administration there
en|are also other difficulties in researching the effects of cannabis many people who smoke cannabis
en|also smoke tobacco this causes confounding factors where questions arise as to whether the tobacco
en|the cannabis or both that have caused a cancer another difficulty researchers have is in
en|recruiting people who smoke cannabis into studies because cannabis is an illegal drug in many
en|countries people may be reluctant to take part in research and if they do agree
en|to take part they may not say how much cannabis they actually smoke footnotes citations
en|a computer font is implemented as a digital data file containing a set of graphically
en|related glyphs a computer font is designed and created using a font editor a computer
en|font specifically designed for the computer screen and not for printing is a screen font
en|in the terminology of movable metal type a font is a set of pieces of
en|movable type in a specific typeface size width weight slope etc for example gill sans
en|bold point or century expanded point and a typeface refers to the collection of related
en|fonts across styles and sizes for example all the varieties of gill sans in html
en|css and related technologies the font family attribute refers to the digital equivalent of a
en|typeface since the s many people outside the printing industry have used the word font
en|as a synonym for typeface there are three basic kinds of computer font file data
en|formats bitmap fonts are faster and easier to create in computer code than other font
en|types but they are not scalable a bitmap font requires a separate font for each
en|size outline and stroke fonts can be resized in a single font by substituting different
en|measurements for components of each glyph but they are more complicated to render on screen
en|or in print than bitmap fonts because they require additional computer code to render the
en|bitmaps to display on screen and in print although all font types are still in
en|use most fonts used on computers today are outline fonts fonts can be monospaced i
en|e every character is plotted a constant distance from the previous character that it is
en|next to while drawing or proportional each character has its own width however the particular
en|font handling application can affect the spacing particularly when justifying text a bitmap font is
en|one that stores each glyph as an array of pixels that is a bitmap it
en|is less commonly known as a raster font or a pixel font bitmap fonts are
en|simply collections of raster images of glyphs for each variant of the font there is
en|a complete set of glyph images with each set containing an image for each character
en|for example if a font has three sizes and any combination of bold and italic
en|then there must be complete sets of images advantages of bitmap fonts include the primary
en|disadvantage of bitmap fonts is that the visual quality tends to be poor when scaled
en|or otherwise transformed compared to outline and stroke fonts and providing many optimized and purpose
en|made sizes of the same font dramatically increases memory usage the earliest bitmap fonts were
en|only available in certain optimized sizes such as and points assuming a resolution of Â
en|dpi with custom fonts often available in only one specific size such as a headline
en|font at only points the limited processing power and memory of early computer systems forced
en|the exclusive use of bitmap fonts improvements in hardware have allowed them to be replaced
en|with outline or stroke fonts in cases where arbitrary scaling is desirable but bitmap fonts
en|are still in common use in embedded systems and other places where speed and simplicity
en|are considered important bitmap fonts are used in the linux console the windows recovery console
en|and embedded systems older dot matrix printers used bitmap fonts often stored in the memory
en|of the printer and addressed by the computer s print driver bitmap fonts may be
en|used in cross stitch to draw a string using a bitmap font means to successively
en|output bitmaps of each character that the string comprises performing per character indentation digital bitmap
en|fonts and the final rendering of vector fonts may use monochrome or shades of gray
en|the latter is anti aliased when displaying a text typically an operating system properly represents
en|the shades of gray as intermediate colors between the color of the font and that
en|of the background however if the text is represented as an image with transparent background
en|shades of gray require an image format allowing partial transparency bitmap fonts look best at
en|their native pixel size some systems using bitmap fonts can create some font variants algorithmically
en|for example the original apple macintosh computer could produce bold by widening vertical strokes and
en|oblique by shearing the image at non native sizes many text rendering systems perform nearest
en|neighbor resampling introducing rough jagged edges more advanced systems perform anti aliasing on bitmap fonts
en|whose size does not match the size that the application requests this technique works well
en|for making the font smaller but not as well for increasing the size as it
en|tends to blur the edges some graphics systems that use bitmap fonts especially those of
en|emulators apply curve sensitive nonlinear resampling algorithms such as xsai or hq x on fonts
en|and other bitmaps which avoids blurring the font while introducing little objectionable distortion at moderate
en|increases in size the difference between bitmap fonts and outline fonts is similar to the
en|difference between bitmap and vector image file formats bitmap fonts are like image formats such
en|as windows bitmap bmp portable network graphics png and tagged image format tif or tiff
en|which store the image data as a grid of pixels in some cases with compression
en|outline or stroke image formats such as windows metafile format wmf and scalable vector graphics
en|format svg store instructions in the form of lines and curves of how to draw
en|the image rather than storing the image itself a trace program can follow the outline
en|of a high resolution bitmap font and create an initial outline that a font designer
en|uses to create an outline font useful in systems such as postscript or truetype outline
en|fonts scale easily without jagged edges or blurriness outline fonts or vector fonts are collections
en|of vector images consisting of lines and curves defining the boundary of glyphs early vector
en|fonts were used by vector monitors and vector plotters using their own internal fonts usually
en|with thin single strokes instead of thickly outlined glyphs the advent of desktop publishing brought
en|the need for a common standard to integrate the graphical user interface of the first
en|macintosh and laser printers the term to describe the integration technology was wysiwyg what you
en|see is what you get this common standard was and still is when adobe postscript
en|citation needed examples of outline fonts include postscript type and type fonts truetype opentype and
en|compugraphic the primary advantage of outline fonts is that unlike bitmap fonts they are a
en|set of lines and curves instead of pixels they can be scaled without causing pixelation
en|therefore outline font characters can be scaled to any size and otherwise transformed with more
en|attractive results than bitmap fonts but require considerably more processing and may yield undesirable rendering
en|depending on the font rendering software and output size even so outline fonts can be
en|transformed into bitmap fonts beforehand if necessary the converse transformation is considerably harder since bitmap
en|fonts require a heuristic algorithm to guess and approximate the corresponding curves if the pixels
en|do not make a straight line outline fonts have a major problem in that the
en|b zier curves used by them cannot be rendered accurately onto a raster display such
en|as most computer monitors and printers and their rendering can change shape depending on the
en|desired size and position measures such as font hinting have to be used to reduce
en|the visual impact of this problem which requires sophisticated software that is difficult to implement
en|correctly many modern desktop computer systems include software to do this but they use considerably
en|more processing power than bitmap fonts and there can be minor rendering defects particularly at
en|small font sizes despite this they are frequently used because people often consider the ability
en|to freely scale fonts without incurring any pixelation to be important enough to justify the
en|defects and increased computational complexity type and type fonts were developed by adobe for professional
en|digital typesetting using postscript the glyphs are outline fonts described with cubic bezier curves type
en|fonts were restricted to a subset of the postscript language and used adobe s hinting
en|system which used to be very expensive type allowed unrestricted use of the postscript language
en|but did not include any hint information which could lead to visible rendering artifacts on
en|low resolution devices such as computer screens and dot matrix printers truetype is a font
en|system originally developed by apple inc it was intended to replace type fonts which many
en|felt were too expensive unlike type fonts truetype glyphs are described with quadratic bezier curves
en|it is currently very popular and implementations exist for all major operating systems opentype is
en|a smart font system designed by adobe and microsoft opentype fonts contain outlines in either
en|the truetype or cff format together with a wide range of metadata a glyph s
en|outline is defined by the vertices of individual stroke paths and the corresponding stroke profiles
en|the stroke paths are a kind of topological skeleton of the glyph the advantages of
en|stroke based fonts over outline fonts include reducing the number of vertices needed to define
en|a glyph allowing the same vertices to be used to generate a font with a
en|different weight glyph width or serifs using different stroke rules and the associated size savings
en|for a font developer editing a glyph by stroke is easier and less prone to
en|error than editing outlines a stroke based system also allows scaling glyphs in height or
en|width without altering stroke thickness of the base glyphs stroke based fonts are heavily marketed
en|for east asian markets for use on embedded devices but the technology is not limited
en|to ideograms commercial developers include agfa monotype itype and type solutions inc owned by bitstream
en|inc have independently developed stroke based font types and font engines although monotype and bitstream
en|have claimed tremendous space saving using stroke based fonts on east asian character sets most
en|of the space saving comes from building composite glyphs which is part of the truetype
en|specification and does not require a stroke based approach metafont uses a different sort of
en|glyph description like truetype it is a vector font description system it draws glyphs using
en|strokes produced by moving a polygonal or elliptical pen approximated by a polygon along a
en|path made from cubic composite b zier curves and straight line segments or by filling
en|such paths although when stroking a path the envelope of the stroke is never actually
en|generated the method causes no loss of accuracy or resolution the method metafont uses is
en|more mathematically complex because the parallel curves of a b zier can be th order
en|algebraic curves in dynacomware developed digitype a stroke based font format in the creators of
en|the saffron type system announced a representation for stroke based fonts called stylized stroke fonts
en|ssfs with the aim of providing the expressiveness of traditional outline based fonts and the
en|small memory footprint of uniform width stroke based fonts usfs autocad uses shx shp fonts
en|a typical font may contain hundreds or even thousands of glyphs often representing characters from
en|many different languages oftentimes users may only need a small subset of the glyphs that
en|are available to them subsetting is the process of removing unnecessary glyphs from a font
en|file usually with the goal of reducing file size this is particularly important for web
en|fonts since reducing file size often means reducing page load time and server load alternatively
en|fonts may be issued in different files for different regions of the world though with
en|the spread of the opentype format this is now increasingly uncommon

nl|dodekanesos fiume en istri eveneens werd de monarchie ter discussie gesteld met name vanwege de
nl|opstelling van het koningshuis ten tijde van dat fascistische bewind in een referendum gehouden op
nl|juni koos een krappe meerderheid van de bevolking voor een staatsvorm als democratische republiek de
nl|verhouding tussen itali en onder meer frankrijk werd geregeld door het verdrag van parijs van
nl|de democratische republikeinse grondwet trad op januari in werking daarin is onder meer bepaald dat
nl|mannelijke afstammelingen van de koninklijke familie itali niet meer in mochten en is hen de

nl|turkije wordt met name in het noorden van itali gezien als de oorzaak van de
nl|stijgende misdaad het is vooral ook een grensoverschrijdend probleem aangezien landen als duitsland verenigd koninkrijk
nl|en nederland voor veel van deze migranten als eindbestemming gelden alhoewel de italiaanse regelgeving in
nl|het kader van schengen inmiddels op niveau is bestaan nog lacunes in de implementatie daarvan
nl|langs de uitgestrekte italiaanse kust in april hebben de italiaanse en de albanese regering een
nl|akkoord gesloten over de jaarlijkse toelating van albanezen in itali voorheen had itali ook al
nl|soortgelijke akkoorden afgesloten met tunesi en marokko itali kent ook een grote toestroom van migranten

nl|op het gebied van immigratie en samenwerking met de landen van oorsprong en de transitlanden
nl|om de grote toestroom immigranten terug te dringen werd in mei een nieuwe immigratiewet goedgekeurd

nl|zijn er geluiden te horen die itali in een ander licht stellen amnesty international meldt
nl|dat er geen specifieke wet is die asielzoekers beschermt en dat de huidige immigratiewetgeving geen
nl|verbetering inhoudt ook het bouwen van detentiekampen in libi keurt zij af meer dan immigranten
nl|zijn volgens amnesty international naar libi uitgezet sinds krijgt libi financi le steun van itali
nl|en militair materieel in ruil voor het tegenhouden van migranten itali helpt op deze manier
nl|dus met het oprichten van opvangkampen in libi voor illegale immigranten verder kent itali volgens
nl|amnesty een gebrekkige asielprocedure die ertoe leidt dat asielzoekers zelfs worden uitgezet vooraleer hun beroepsprocedure
nl|tegen een afwijzing begint te lopen dit gebeurde bijvoorbeeld met de vluchtelingen op het duitse
nl|schip cap anamur in eerste instantie stelde itali dat het niet verantwoordelijk was voor de
nl|behandeling van de asielaanvragen aangezien het schip eerst malta had aangedaan maar dit is volgens
nl|amnesty niet het geval omdat de vluchtelingen niet in malta de mogelijkheid hadden gehad om
nl|een asielaanvraag in te dienen het eerste land waar de vluchtelingen de mogelijkheid hebben om
nl|asiel aan te vragen wordt gezien als het land dat het behandelt en dan kijkt
nl|of het verantwoordelijk is voor de afhandeling van het asielverzoek ook is het zo dat
nl|minderjarige asielzoekers in itali eerst opgesloten worden in gewone detentiekampen voor ze in jeugdkampen terechtkomen
nl|de grote meerderheid van de bevolking spreekt italiaans waaronder verscheidene dialecten het italiaans komt van

nl|op de italiaanse cultuur uit een onderzoek gehouden in het jaar is gebleken dat nog
nl|steeds van de italianen zichzelf als rooms katholiek zien iets meer dan een derde van

nl|de tweede wereldoorlog lange tijd gedomineerd door drie partijen de communistische italiaanse communistische partij pci
nl|met in het begin van de jaren van de kiezers achter zich en de christendemocratische
nl|democrazia cristiana dc toen goed voor alsmede de sociaaldemocratische partito socialista italiano psi de angst
nl|voor de communistische partij was een van de factoren die de dc hielp van tot
nl|in het zadel te blijven in diverse coalities veelal samen met de psi toenmalig premier
nl|aldo moro was in de jaren een van de weinigen die begreep dat de uitsluiting
nl|van de pci voor de regering ook een voortdurende uitsluiting van een belangrijk deel van
nl|het electoraat betekende hij deed pogingen om een zogenaamd historisch compromis met de pci te
nl|bereiken maar werd echter in door de rode brigades ontvoerd en vervolgens vermoord waarna het
nl|idee verder geen vervolg kreeg in een laatste poging om het oude politieke systeem te
nl|redden werd in de socialist bettino craxi premier die voor het eerst in de naoorlogse
nl|geschiedenis zijn regering zo goed als de gehele termijn bij elkaar kon houden hierna echter
nl|kwam een serie corruptieschandalen aan het licht die weliswaar alle partijen trof maar vooral de
nl|machthebbende dc en de psi van craxi in een diepe crisis stortte uiteindelijk leidde deze
nl|crisis zelfs tot de opheffing van zowel de dc alsmede de psi in de periode
nl|deze operatie man pulite schone handen kwam in op gang na de ontdekking van grootscheepse
nl|politieke corruptie in milaan tangentopoli omkoopstad door onderzoeksrechter di pietro en op basis van de
nl|onderzoeken naar aanleiding van de moorden op rechters en maffiabestrijders falcone en borsellino het gevolg
nl|was dat het kiessysteem volledig werd hervormd voornamelijk tot een meerderheidssysteem met districtenstelsel en de
nl|politieke constellatie werd tegelijk volledig door elkaar geschud vanaf de jaren werd de italiaanse politiek
nl|beheerst door enerzijds een rechts blok met forza italia de partij van silvio berlusconi de
nl|separatistische en xenofobe lega nord van umberto bossi en de neofascistische alleanza nazionale daartegenover stond
nl|een centrumlinks blok ulivo olijfgroen toen onder leiding van voormalig europees commissievoorzitter romano prodi president
nl|tot begin was giorgio napolitano ook al van linkse garnituur hij behoorde tot de partij
nl|democratici di sinistra sinds januari van dat jaar bekleedde senaatsvoorzitter pietro grasso deze functie als
nl|tijdelijke overgangsmaatregel centrumlinks won op en april nipt de verkiezingen en voorkwam zo dat de
nl|kort daarv r gevallen rechtse regering berlusconi een nieuwe termijn kreeg deze had een populistische
nl|neoliberale conservatieve politiek gevolgd en werd tegelijk geteisterd door beschuldigingen van corruptie vooral aan het
nl|adres van premier berlusconi hij zou fiscale fraude gepleegd en rechters omgekocht hebben als leider
nl|van zijn zakenimperium hij stelde zichzelf echter buiten vervolging door een wet die de premier
nl|onschendbaarheid verschaft zolang hij in functie is sindsdien zijn alle corruptiezaken tegen hem zo goed
nl|als verjaard berlusconi kreeg ook scherpe kritiek omdat hij als eigenaar van drie commerci le
nl|televisiestations een mediamonopolie had dat hij misbruikte bovendien zuiverde hij als premier ook de openbare
nl|omroep rai van al te kritische journalisten en programmamakers na zijn verkiezingsnederlaag van maakte berlusconi
nl|gewag van fraude maar daar bleek uiteindelijk niets van aan prodi had de verkiezingen nipt
nl|gewonnen met tegen de winst is vooral gekomen dankzij de stemmen uit het buitenland van
nl|italianen buiten itali die voor het eerst stemrecht hadden verkregen een wetsverandering overigens waar met
nl|name rechts jarenlang voor had gepleit sinds de verkiezingen van werd het land vervolgens geregeerd
nl|door de centrumlinkse regering van prodi die echter in een voortdurende staat van crisis het
nl|land bestuurde aangezien de meerderheid in het parlement met name in de senaat dermate klein
nl|was dat regelmatig de vertrouwenskwestie aan de orde kwam om ook echt alle stemmen van
nl|links mee te laten stemmen ten faveure van de voorgestelde regeringsbesluiten uiteindelijk viel de regering
nl|dan ook op januari nadat de kleine partij udeur zetels in de senaat onder leiding
nl|van minister mastella zijn steun ingetrokken had hiermee kon de regering niet meer op een
nl|meerderheid in de senaat terugvallen en moest prodi zijn ontslag aanbieden aan president napolitano laatstgenoemde
nl|besloot na een mislukte poging tot het formeren van een interim regering verkiezingen uit te
nl|schrijven voor april na deze val van de regering prodi werd het rechtse blok nog
nl|steeds aangevoerd door silvio berlusconi het linkse blok werd geleid door walter veltroni ex burgemeester
nl|van rome en partijleider van de destijds pas opgezette partito democratico pd de consituerende delen
nl|van de pd onder andere ook de grootste als ds en margherita hebben zich vastgelegd

nl|de motor van de italiaanse economie veelal gaat het om familiebedrijven die met name in
nl|de jaren zijn opgericht in deze periode maakte de italiaanse economie een moeilijke tijd door
nl|deze verschuiving in de italiaanse bedrijfscultuur kwam er vooral door het veranderende consumptiegedrag en het
nl|gebrek aan flexibiliteit van de italiaanse multinationals net te wijten was aan het familisme de

nl|het met name over de siciliaanse maffia de cosa nostra de napolitaanse de camorra de
nl|ndrangheta actief in calabri en de sacra corona unita actief in apuli de aanwezigheid van
nl|deze organisaties vooral in het zuiden kan in verband worden gebracht met de economische problemen
nl|in zuid itali ten opzichte van het noorden sinds de jaren probeert de italiaanse overheid
nl|door middel van een ontwikkelingsfonds voor het zuiden cassa del mezzogiorno de welvaartskloof met het
nl|noorden te dichten in het begin deed men dat door de agrarische sector te moderniseren
nl|en de italiaanse infrastructuur te verbeteren toen echter duidelijk werd dat deze manier van investeren
nl|de werkgelegenheid juist verkleinde kwam de nadruk te liggen op een snelle industrialisatie van het
nl|gebied hoewel die de achterstand van het zuiden ten opzichte van het noorden niet kon
nl|wegnemen is het inkomensniveau in zuid itali wel toegenomen de groei van de italiaanse economie
nl|na de tweede wereldoorlog heeft dan ook vooral in het noorden van het land plaatsgevonden
nl|de industriecomplexen in het zuiden zijn vaak arbeidsintensief en statisch van structuur en kunnen vaak
nl|alleen door middel van overheidssteun voortbestaan een voorbeeld hiervan is de oprichting van de alfa
nl|romeo sud of alfa zuidfabriek door de italiaanse overheid in pomigliano d arco bij napels
nl|later geprivatiseerd via overname door fiat door deze ongunstige economische ontwikkeling van het zuiden is

nl|verwoede manuscriptenverzamelaars onder de italiaanse humanisten zijn vriend en tijdgenoot boccaccio was de schrijver van

nl|maria boiardo orlando innamorato en ludovico ariosto orlando furioso e eeuwse schrijvers zoals de dichter
nl|poliziano en de platoonse filosoof ficino maakten vertalingen van zowel latijnse als griekse teksten in

nl|manuzio ontwikkelde namelijk het italic lettertype alsook het kleine relatief draagbare en goedkope gedrukte boek
nl|daarnaast was hij ook de eerste die boeken in oudgrieks publiceerde itali was steeds belangrijk
nl|voor de ontwikkeling van de europese muziek het werk van guido van arezzo uit de
nl|e eeuw wordt beschouwd als een van de belangrijkste grondslagen van de moderne muzieknotatie de
nl|muziek van palestrina vormde een hoogtepunt van de renaissancemuziek en rond ontstond de opera in

nl|met onder anderen claudio monteverdi gioachino rossini giuseppe verdi en giacomo puccini als prominente operacomponisten
nl|tijdens de barok maakte de muziek in itali ook een bloeitijd door met componisten als
nl|monteverdi antonio vivaldi domenico scarlatti en giovanni battista pergolesi in deze tijd trokken ook veel
nl|componisten uit andere europese landen naar itali om daar het componeren verder te leren ook
nl|het feit dat veel muziektermen afkomstig zijn uit het italiaans duidt op de grote invloed
nl|van itali op de geschreven muziek verder was er in de e eeuw bijvoorbeeld ennio
nl|morricone voor de filmmuziek en voor de progressieve rock onder anderen franco battiato de italiaanse
nl|literatuur ontstond in het begin van de e eeuw ietwat laat vergeleken met literatuur van

nl|eerder bekend als freedom tower is een wolkenkrabber in new york die met zijn hoogte
nl|van meter het hoogste gebouw van het amerikaanse continent is het in lower manhattan gesitueerde
nl|kantoorgebouw is het op zes na hoogste gebouw ter wereld en is onderdeel van het
nl|nieuwe world trade center de naam verwijst naar de wolkenkrabber one world trade center ook
nl|wel north tower genoemd van het oorspronkelijke world trade center dat verwoest werd tijdens de
nl|terroristische aanslagen op september de bouw van het one world trade center startte op april
nl|en de opening vond plaats op november met het intrekken van de grootste huurder uitgever
nl|cond nast het gebouw is ontwikkeld door de port authority of new york and new
nl|jersey en wordt beheerd door the durst organization de hoogte van het one world trade
nl|center tot de top bedraagt meter maar de zogenaamde architectonische hoogte waarbij wel de spits
nl|maar niet de zich daar nog boven bevindende bliksemafleider wordt meegerekend bedraagt een symbolische voet
nl|of omgerekend meter die hoogte verwijst naar het jaar waarin de amerikaanse onafhankelijkheidsverklaring werd ondertekend
nl|de bovenste verdieping van het one world trade center heeft het nummer maar in werkelijkheid
nl|zijn er bovengrondse verdiepingen in de nummering zijn namelijk tien cijfers overgeslagen naast bovengrondse verdiepingen
nl|telt het one world trade center een vijftal ondergrondse verdiepingen de periode voorafgaand aan de
nl|bouw ging gepaard met getouwtrek over wat er met het terrein van de voormalige twin
nl|towers moest gebeuren en nadat was besloten dat er een nieuwe wolkenkrabber moest komen vonden
nl|er in het ontwerp enkele revisies plaats het uiteindelijke ontwerp kwam van het architectenbureau skidmore
nl|owings and merrill onder leiding van hoofdarchitect david childs in werd op de huidige locatie
nl|van het one world trade center het originele world trade center geopend maar nog geen
nl|dertig jaar later op september werd dit gehele complex vernietigd door een terroristische aanslag waarbij
nl|twee passagiersvliegtuigen de twee belangrijkste torens van het complex bijgenaamd de twin towers doorboorden de
nl|huidige locatie van het one world trade center werd destijds ingenomen door het six world
nl|trade center dat werd gesloopt vanwege de grote schade die het tijdens de aanslagen had
nl|opgelopen minder dan twee maanden voor de vernietiging van het complex sloot vastgoedhandelaar larry silverstein
nl|een contract met de bezitter van de grond de port authority of new york and
nl|new jersey om het complex voor een periode van jaar te huren hoewel het complex
nl|niet meer bestond moest silverstein ook na de vernietiging van de gebouwen nog huur over
nl|de grond betalen silverstein gaf een week na de aanslagen aan dat hij graag nieuwe
nl|wolkenkrabbers op die grond zag de bevolking van new york raakte echter sterk verdeeld over
nl|de toekomst van de plek een deel vond dat er nieuwe al dan niet hogere
nl|gebouwen moesten komen en een ander deel zag het als gewijde grond en wilde dat
nl|er een sober gedenkteken zou komen in november richtte rudy giuliani de burgemeester van new
nl|york samen met de gouverneur van de staat new york george pataki de lower manhattan
nl|development corporation lmdc op dit overheidsorgaan moest samen met de port authority beslissen wat er
nl|met het terrein zou gebeuren tijdens het daaropvolgende proces ontving gouverneur pataki veel kritiek omdat
nl|hij zowel in de lmdc als in de port authority een aandeel van had volgens
nl|critici zou hij die macht voornamelijk hebben gebruikt voor zijn verkiezingscampagne ook de huurder van
nl|de grond silverstein was belangrijk in het proces en ontving van zijn verzekeraars een uitbetaling
nl|van miljard dollar voor de schade silverstein ging echter naar de rechter omdat de verzekeraars
nl|de aanslagen zagen als n gebeurtenis terwijl hij van mening was dat het twee losstaande
nl|gebeurtenissen waren om zodoende zijn uitbetaling te verdubbelen toen eind de burgemeesterstermijn van giuliani afliep
nl|stelde hij in zijn afscheidsspeech dat hij zelf vond dat het terrein geen plaats van
nl|economische ontwikkeling mocht worden maar dat het gehele terrein een gedenkteken zou moeten worden snel
nl|na de aanslag werd de bouw van het world trade center gestart dit kon zo
nl|snel doordat alleen de port authority de lmdc en silverstein over de nieuwbouw konden beslissen
nl|over het herbouwen van de rest van het complex hadden echter naast de port authority
nl|de lmdc en silverstein ook elf lokale vijf provinciale en negen federale organisaties inspraak uit
nl|vergaderingen tussen de organisaties bleek dat de meningen hopeloos verdeeld waren sommige organisaties wilden nieuwe
nl|wolkenkrabbers andere alleen een gedenkteken en weer andere een exacte herbouw van de originele twin
nl|towers ook de new yorkse bevolking was nog steeds erg verdeeld over de kwestie om
nl|toch de ontwikkeling op gang te laten komen schakelde de lmdc het architectenbureau beyer blinder
nl|belle in om de gebruiksmogelijkheden van de grond te onderzoeken in juli werd er een
nl|vergadering met ruim new yorkse burgers georganiseerd om te kijken wat zij van de gemaakte
nl|ontwerpen vonden veel mensen en organisaties vonden de ontwerpen niet voldoen waarop de lmdc tijdens
nl|een spoedvergadering besloot om een wedstrijd voor architectenbureaus uit te schrijven er werden wel richtlijnen
nl|bepaald waaraan de ontwerpen dienden te voldoen zo moest het gebouw of symbool bijvoorbeeld hoog
nl|genoeg zijn en de fundering van de originele twin towers moesten onbebouwd blijven in december
nl|werden de zeven finalisten van de wedstrijd aan het publiek gepresenteerd waarbij het ontwerp van
nl|daniel libeskind en dat van een team bestaande uit onder anderen rafael vi oly het
nl|positiefst werden ontvangen het ontwerp van libeskind omvatte een wolkenkrabber met een hoogte van meter
nl|enkele andere gebouwen en twee parken het park van helden en de wieg van licht
nl|het ontwerp van vi oly was compleet anders en hield twee constructies bestaande uit balken
nl|in die het ontbreken van de twin towers zouden benadrukken beide architecten voerden hard campagne
nl|en uiteindelijk koos de lmdc het ontwerp van het team van vi oly gouverneur pataki
nl|prefereerde echter het ontwerp van libeskind hij legde de keuze van de lmdc naast zich
nl|neer en benoemde tegen silversteins wil in libeskind tot hoofdplanner toen libeskind als hoofdplanner was
nl|gekozen wilde hij ook de ontwerper worden van het gebouw maar volgens de lmdc was
nl|dat onverstandig aangezien hij geen ervaring had met het ontwerpen van wolkenkrabbers hij ging uiteindelijk
nl|samenwerken met de door silverstein gekozen architect david childs van het architectenbureau skidmore owings and
nl|merrill childs had w l eerder wolkenkrabbers ontworpen en had in opdracht van silverstein al
nl|een ontwerp gemaakt op december werd in de federal hall in lower manhattan een model
nl|van de toekomstige freedom tower onthuld het enige wat nog over was van libeskinds oorspronkelijke
nl|ontwerp was de torenspits en de symbolische hoogte van voet ook werd bekendgemaakt dat het
nl|gebouw verdiepingen zou gaan tellen en dat het gebouw in of zou worden geopend ruim
nl|een half jaar nadat het model werd getoond werd op juli independence day de hoeksteen
nl|van de toekomstige freedom tower onthuld en geplaatst bij de plechtigheid waren naast de architecten
nl|ook silverstein en pataki aanwezig hoewel het de bedoeling was dat na de ceremonie de
nl|bouw van de toren definitief zou beginnen was dat uiteindelijk niet het geval het new
nl|york city police department stuurde een brief waarin stond dat het gebouw niet aan de
nl|veiligheidseisen voldeed de freedom tower had volgens de politie namelijk een te hoog risico op
nl|aanslagen en door zijn ligging dicht bij een hoofdweg was er een groot risico op
nl|een autobom de brief betekende dat het gehele gebouw moest worden herontworpen aangezien het niet
nl|simpelweg kon worden verplaatst de architecten begonnen nadat het project een tijdlang had stilgelegen in
nl|mei weer van begin af aan om het gebouw zo te ontwerpen dat het ook
nl|aan de veiligheidseisen voldeed maar ditmaal was libeskind echter helemaal niet meer bij het ontwerp
nl|betrokken om het ontwerp w l aan de veiligheidseisen te laten voldoen werd onder andere
nl|het onderste deel van het gebouw veranderd zodat het van beton werd en daardoor bestendiger
nl|tegen explosies en inslagen tijdens de ontwerpfase had de rechter uitspraak gedaan over de na
nl|de aanslagen gestarte rechtszaak van silverstein tegen een aantal verzekeraars hij wilde dat de aanslagen
nl|als twee losstaande gebeurtenissen werden beschouwd om zo tweemaal zoveel verzekeringsgeld te kunnen innen hoewel
nl|de rechter silverstein in het gelijk stelde ontving hij uiteindelijk miljard dollar van de verzekeraars
nl|in plaats van de beoogde miljard ook had zich een andere cruciale verandering tijdens de
nl|ontwerpfase voorgedaan de port authority werd de nieuwe ontwikkelaar van de freedom tower de port
nl|authority wilde namelijk volledige zeggenschap over de bouwgrond en was bereid om de huur van
nl|silverstein daarvoor te verlagen gouverneur pataki had maart als deadline gesteld voor die deal maar
nl|de deadline werd niet gehaald uiteindelijk stuurde de port authority silverstein een voorstel en silverstein
nl|stemde daarmee in het voorstel hield in dat de port authority de enige ontwikkelaar werd
nl|van het one world trade center en het five world trade center en dat silverstein
nl|aan de andere kant aandelen ontving om de andere drie toekomstige gebouwen gedeeltelijk mee te
nl|bekostigen door de deal raakte het proces in een stroomversnelling omdat de port authority nu
nl|kon doen wat zij wilde de bouw van de definitieve freedom tower later hernoemd tot
nl|one world trade center begon uiteindelijk op april met een ceremonie waar onder anderen gouverneur
nl|pataki bij aanwezig was de hoeksteen die zich door de verplaatsing op een geheel nutteloze
nl|plaats bevond werd op juni onaangekondigd verwijderd om zo geen media aandacht te trekken de
nl|hoeksteen is uiteindelijk verplaatst naar het hoofdkantoor van de maker op juni twee maanden na
nl|de start van de bouw werd een model van het uiteindelijk ontwerp onthuld door hoofdarchitect
nl|david childs steven plate kreeg de leiding over de bouw in het begin van juli
nl|lag de bouw voor vier dagen stil door een staking van de bestuurders van de
nl|kranen de regionale staking had volgens toezichthouder angelo sisco een kleiner effect doordat n dag
nl|een feestdag was waarop de arbeiders sowieso vrij zouden hebben gehad en het een andere
nl|dag stormde waardoor de werkzaamheden anders ook al zouden zijn stopgezet tijdens graafwerkzaamheden voor de
nl|fundering stuitte het bouwteam op een e eeuws schip dat uiteindelijk werd weggehaald en overgebracht
nl|naar een museum toen de fundering gereed was werd op december begonnen met de stalen
nl|constructie in bijzijn van gouverneur george pataki en burgemeester michael bloomberg nabestaanden van de aanslagen
nl|hadden een paar dagen daarvoor de kans gekregen om op de eerste stalen balk een
nl|bericht te schrijven en om er foto s op te plakken bij de bouw werd
nl|als volgt te werk gegaan bovenin maakten de staalwerkers nieuwe verdiepingen gevolgd door betonwerkers die
nl|de betonnen vloeren goten met daaronder de betonwerkers die de betonnen kern goten en helemaal
nl|onderaan de bouwvakkers die het glas in het gebouw zetten toen de bouw op gang
nl|was gekomen werd er zes dagen per week door mensen gewerkt drie jaar na de
nl|start van de bouw op maart maakte de port authority bekend dat de freedom tower
nl|voortaan als het one world trade center door het leven zou gaan die naamswijziging werd
nl|doorgevoerd wegens marketingredenen en stuitte op veel kritiek volgens tegenstanders van de naamswijziging ging de
nl|toren steeds meer op een normaal kantoorgebouw lijken in de winter van werd begonnen met
nl|het installeren van het glas maar new york werd geteisterd door een strenge winter met
nl|veel sneeuw daardoor lag de bouw van eind december tot februari grotendeels stil er werden
nl|mensen ingeschakeld om de sneeuw te ruimen toen in maart de bouw weer verderging was
nl|het gebouw halverwege zijn uiteindelijke hoogte maar naarmate het one world trade center hoger werd
nl|kregen de bouwvakkers steeds meer last van de sterke wind niet alleen de bouwvakkers zelf
nl|hadden last van de wind maar vooral ook de kranen die soms niet konden worden
nl|gebruikt wegens een te sterke wind later in het jaar op september exact tien jaar
nl|na de aanslagen vond een uitgebreide herdenking plaats en werd het herdenkingsmonument geopend ook bereikte
nl|het one world trade center rond dat tijdstip een hoogte van voet circa meter dat
nl|doel werd gesteld om bij de herdenking vooruitgang uit te stralen in het volgende jaar
nl|bleef de hoogte van het one world trade center groeien en op april oversteeg het
nl|gebouw het empire state building waarmee het one world trade center het hoogste gebouw van
nl|new york werd anderhalve maand later op juni werd de bouwplaats bezocht door president barack
nl|obama en first lady michelle obama samen met andrew cuomo gouverneur van de staat new
nl|york chris christie gouverneur van de staat new jersey en michael bloomberg burgemeester van new
nl|york zetten zij hun handtekening op een stalen balk die op augustus aan het one
nl|world trade center werd bevestigd in dezelfde maand waarin de stalen balk met de handtekeningen
nl|van onder anderen obama aan het one world trade center werd bevestigd bereikte het gebouw
nl|op augustus de hoogte van het dak van het oude world trade center twee maanden
nl|later in oktober werd new york getroffen door de orkaan sandy die aan bijna mensen
nl|het leven kostte ook het one world trade center liep schade op de kelder liep
nl|vol met miljoen liter water hoewel constructiehoofd steven plate de burgemeester vertelde dat het wegpompen
nl|van het water tussen de twee en vier weken zou duren duurde het uiteindelijk niet
nl|meer dan twee dagen de bouw ging weer verder en op december bereikte ook het
nl|betonteam de bovenste verdieping waardoor kon worden begonnen met het installeren van de spits de
nl|spits kwam met de boot aan en werd gedurende de late avond en de vroege
nl|nacht door lower manhattan getransporteerd met een escorte van de politie vanwege de grootte van
nl|het vervoer die nacht werden negen van de in totaal achttien delen van de spits
nl|naar de bouwplaats gebracht op februari werden de liften ge nstalleerd daarv r gingen de
nl|bouwvakkers op en neer met externe liften die later werden afgebroken op mei bereikte het
nl|one world trade center uiteindelijk zijn top door de installatie van het laatste deel van
nl|zijn spits na die datum werd er vooral gewerkt aan het interieur van het gebouw
nl|de bouw van het one world trade center duurde in zijn totaliteit ruim acht jaar
nl|en kostte miljard dollar dat is bijna n miljard dollar meer dan eerder gedacht en
nl|het is daarmee een van de duurste gebouwen ooit gebouwd op maandag november werd het
nl|one world trade center zonder enige ceremonie geopend met het intrekken van de huurder cond
nl|nast die er haar hoofdkantoor heeft op die datum trokken er echter pas van de
nl|geplande werknemers van het bedrijf in de verhuizing zou namelijk volgens planning tot januari of
nl|februari duren de opening verliep echter niet geheel vlekkeloos er werden vele ratten aangetroffen in
nl|het kantoor van vogue met als gevolg dat onder anderen hoofdredactrice anna wintour het kantoor
nl|weigerde te betreden ook deed zich ongeveer een week na de opening een incident voor
nl|toen een kabel van het bakje van de glazenwassers losschoot waardoor twee glazenwassers vast kwamen
nl|te zitten ze werden uiteindelijk ter hoogte van de e verdieping gered waarbij de brandweer
nl|een ruit van het gebouw opensneed het observatorium one world observatory werd op mei geopend
nl|middels een ceremonie waarbij een lintje werd geknipt voorafgaand aan de opening van het observatorium
nl|werd daar op mei eenmalig het ochtendprogramma cbs this morning uitgezonden het one world trade
nl|center maakt deel uit van het wtc complex in het financi le hart van lower
nl|manhattan binnen het wtc complex bevindt het gebouw zich in de noordwesthoek ten noorden van
nl|het herdenkingsmonument en museum ter nagedachtenis aan de slachtoffers van de aanslagen op september de
nl|toren wordt beginnend bij het noorden met de klok mee omsloten door vesey street het
nl|toekomstige performing arts center fulton street en west street fulton en vesey street zijn niet
nl|toegankelijk voor onbevoegde voertuigen en het bestemmingsverkeer wordt om veiligheidsredenen gecontroleerd v r het betreden
nl|van de straten het adres is fulton street in de directe omgeving van het gebouw
nl|bevinden zich onder andere liberty park brookfield place wall street trinity church het stadhuis en
nl|het woolworth building ook bevindt het gebouw zich minder dan meter ten oosten van de
nl|hudson het one world trade center is ook bereikbaar met de metro het metrostation world
nl|trade center diende als eindstation van de metrolijnen newark world trade center en hoboken world
nl|trade center beide in het beheer van path het metrostation werd volgens planning op maart
nl|vervangen door een nieuw station de world trade center transportation hub naast beide lijnen van
nl|path stoppen hier ook metro s van elf metrolijnen van de new york city subway
nl|de lijnen a c e j z r en de lobby van het one world
nl|trade center en het metrostation zijn verbonden via een ondergrondse doorgang met winkels die doorloopt
nl|tot de battery park city ferry terminal het one world trade center heeft de vorm
nl|van een kubus met daarbovenop een langgerekt vierzijdig antiprisma door deze vorm heeft het gebouw
nl|een vierkant grondplan en is het dak dat eveneens vierkant is graden gedraaid ten opzichte
nl|van het grondplan afhankelijk van de kijkhoek toont het gebouw zich als een rechthoek of
nl|een hoog gelijkbenig trapezium het gebouw heeft een stalen skelet met betonnen vloeren en een
nl|betonnen kern om die constructie heen bevinden zich glasplaten halverwege het one world trade center
nl|bevinden zich belangrijke knooppunten van de stalen balken die knooppunten zijn tien keer zo zwaar
nl|als de andere stalen balken en spelen een belangrijke rol in de versteviging van het
nl|gebouw ook de vorm van het one world trade center helpt om het gebouw te
nl|stabiliseren de vorm die verandert naarmate het gebouw hoger reikt minimaliseert namelijk vortexwinden die het
nl|gebouw anders zouden kunnen laten vibreren of die de glasplaten uit de gevel zouden kunnen
nl|rukken om dat laatste te voorkomen lopen de glasplaten bovendien door van de grond tot
nl|het plafond van elke verdieping in de betonnen kern bevinden zich liften en twee noodtrappen
nl|daarnaast bevinden zich in het gebouw elf roltrappen van de liften gaan er tien liften
nl|naar het dak namelijk de vijf serviceliften en de vijf liften van het observatorium in
nl|de liften naar het observatorium wordt bij de weg omhoog een time lapse van de
nl|geschiedenis van manhattan getoond werknemers en klanten van in het gebouw gevestigde bedrijven die tot
nl|boven de e verdieping willen gaan moeten op die verdieping overstappen naar een andere lift
nl|sommige liften in het one world trade center halen een topsnelheid van Â km h
nl|en behoren daarmee tot de snelste van de verenigde staten daardoor is het mogelijk de
nl|bovenste verdiepingen van het gebouw binnen n minuut te bereiken beneden in het one world
nl|trade center bevindt zich een kelder met vijf verdiepingen die ondergrondse verdiepingen dienen als serviceruimte
nl|opslagruimte voor huurders en winkelcentrum het winkelgedeelte loopt door tot aan de transportation hub een
nl|metrostation direct boven de grond bevindt zich de meter hoge basis met een betonnen gevel
nl|waarin zich de meter hoge lobby en negen verdiepingen met technische installaties bevinden in de
nl|lobby bevindt zich een bijna meter lange muurschildering genaamd one union of the senses gemaakt
nl|door kunstenaar jos parl op grondniveau bevindt zich aan de zuidkant de hoofdingang maar ook
nl|de andere drie zijden beschikken over een ingang in de betonnen basis bevinden zich slechts
nl|enkele kleinere ramen en de gevel van de basis wordt omhuld door glaspanelen met een
nl|reflecterende laag eerst was het plan om de gevel met prismatische glaspanelen en gelaste aluminiumplaten
nl|te omhullen maar dat plan werd in mei geschrapt omdat het moeilijk was te realiseren
nl|boven de betonnen basis beginnen de verdiepingen met kantoren doorlopend tot en met de e
nl|verdieping tussen de verdiepingen van de basis en de kantoren zijn in de nummering echter
nl|negen verdiepingen weggelaten waardoor de kantoorruimte dus in werkelijkheid doorloopt tot de e verdieping de
nl|kantoorruimte wordt gekenmerkt door open ruimtes rond de betonnen kern zonder de aanwezigheid van kolommen
nl|op de e verdieping bevindt zich de zogenaamde sky lobby boven de kantoorruimte bevinden zich
nl|nog tien verdiepingen met technische installaties en daartussenin het drie verdiepingen tellende observatorium dat de
nl|naam one world observatory draagt tussen de verdiepingen met technische installaties en het observatorium zijn
nl|eveneens verdiepingen in de nummering weggelaten het observatorium bevindt zich net als bij de twin
nl|towers op meter hoogte en beslaat de verdiepingen tot en met het wordt verhuurd aan
nl|legends hospitality llc en bevat een restaurant het is te betreden via vijf speciaal daarvoor
nl|gereserveerde liften op het dak van het one world trade center bevindt zich een meter
nl|hoge spits waarvan het onderste deel wordt omringd door een kroon aan die kroon zijn
nl|communicatie instrumenten bevestigd de stalen uit achttien delen bestaande spits wordt niet bedekt door een
nl|omhulsel hoewel dat oorspronkelijk wel de bedoeling was het omhulsel bleek in een windtunnel echter
nl|al bij normale windsnelheden hevig te vibreren om de vibraties van de spits nog verder
nl|te verminderen is de spits met kabels bevestigd aan de kroon in de top van
nl|de spits bevindt zich onder andere een langzaam ronddraaiend baken vergelijkbaar met dat van een
nl|vuurtoren dat de letter n in morsecode uitzendt die n staat daarin voor new york
nl|city het baken omvat ledlichtjes en is zichtbaar vanaf een afstand van maximaal kilometer boven
nl|het baken bevinden zich nog meer ledlichtjes die niet zullen ronddraaien de ledlichtjes boven in
nl|de spits kunnen worden bestuurd vanaf de grond en kunnen van kleur veranderen boven op
nl|de spits bevindt zich nog een vijf meter hoge bliksemafleider die niet bij de hoogte
nl|van het gebouw wordt meegerekend het one world trade center staat bekend als een van
nl|de veiligste wolkenkrabbers ter wereld en is zo gebouwd om een aanslag als op september
nl|te voorkomen en om de schade bij een dergelijke aanslag te minimaliseren het gebouw is
nl|daarnaast ook ontworpen om stormen en aardbevingen te overleven het one world trade center heeft
nl|een betonnen kern die bestaat uit extra sterk beton dat minimaal en maximaal bar aan
nl|druk kan weerstaan in new york werd nooit eerder beton gebruikt dat tegen een dergelijke
nl|druk bestand is de wand van de kern heeft een dikte van tussen de centimeter
nl|en de n meter in de betonnen kern bevinden zich naast de liften en de
nl|noodtrappen ook de water en elektriciteitsleidingen zodat die goed beschermd zijn voor het geval dat
nl|de elektriciteit uitvalt is er ook een noodgenerator aanwezig het one world trade center heeft
nl|in tegenstelling tot de meeste wolkenkrabbers twee noodtrappen in plaats van n noodtrap een van
nl|de twee noodtrappen is speciaal gemaakt voor brandweerlieden zodat zij geen hinder ondervinden van naar
nl|beneden gaande werknemers zoals dat het geval was tijdens de aanslagen op september de andere
nl|noodtrap voor naar beneden gaand verkeer is extra breed en bevindt zich in een schacht
nl|die onder druk staat om te voorkomen dat als een deur wordt geopend de schacht
nl|volloopt met rook ook is er in de schacht een installatie om de lucht te
nl|verversen naast de kern is ook de rest van het one world trade center extra
nl|stevig ontworpen zo is het glas dikker dan normaal zodat het intact blijft in geval
nl|van een explosie en bestaat de wand van de onderste meter van het gebouw uit
nl|beton om zo een autobom tot kilogram te kunnen overleven daarnaast is er voor de
nl|brandweer ook een communicatiesysteem aanwezig om contact te kunnen leggen met de kantoormensen en de
nl|managers van het gebouw om een aanslag met een autobom te voorkomen is het voor
nl|onbevoegde voertuigen verboden om een aantal omliggende straten binnen te rijden wel bevoegde voertuigen moeten
nl|dat bij de checkpoints rond het gebied kunnen aantonen en worden gecontroleerd op explosieven de
nl|architectonische hoogte van het one world trade center bedraagt meter daarmee is het one world
nl|trade center het op vijf na hoogste gebouw ter wereld alleen de lotte world tower
nl|het ping an finance centre de abraj al bait toren de shanghai tower en de
nl|burj khalifa zijn hoger de hoogte van het one world trade center genereerde enige controverse
nl|sommigen zagen de meter hoge stalen constructie op het dak als een spits wat betekent
nl|dat het bij de hoogte wordt meegerekend anderen zagen het dan weer als een antenne
nl|die niet bij de hoogte wordt meegerekend op november besloot de height committee onderdeel van
nl|de council on tall buildings and urban habitat dat de stalen constructie een spits is
nl|en daarom wel meetelt als was besloten dat de stalen constructie toch een antenne was
nl|werd de hoogte van het dak als architectonische hoogte genomen het dak bevindt zich net
nl|als bij de voormalige twin towers op meter hoogte overigens bevindt de top van het
nl|one world trade center zich niet op maar op meter hoogte op de spits staat
nl|namelijk nog een bliksemafleider die niet bij de architectonische hoogte wordt meegeteld naast de hoogte
nl|tot het dak zijn ook de afmetingen van het grondplan soortgelijk aan die van de
nl|twin towers het grondplan van de twin towers mat bij meter en dat van het
nl|one world trade center meet bij meter de vloeroppervlakte van de ruimte binnenin het het
nl|one world trade center bedraagt vierkante meter waarvan vierkante meter wordt ingenomen door kantoorruimte ruim
nl|van de in totaal vierkante meter van het one world trade center wordt in beslag
nl|genomen door kantoorruimte ondanks grote huurders als uitgever cond nast had het gebouw eind een
nl|leegstand van circa procent de prijs van de kantoorruimte in het one world trade center
nl|varieert zo kost een vierkante meter onder de sky lobby gevestigd op de e verdieping
nl|een kleine Â per jaar en een vierkante meter boven die verdieping tussen de Â
nl|en de Â om meer huurders aan te trekken werd in mei de prijs voor
nl|vierkante meters onder de sky lobby verlaagd naar iets meer dan Â om potenti le
nl|huurders de mogelijkheden te laten zien is de e verdieping sinds eind ingericht als marketingcentrum
nl|van the durst organization the durst organization schakelde cushman wakefield in om huurders te vinden

nl|wereldvrede bevorderen de ontstaansgeschiedenis van het wilhelminakanaal beschrijft hoe de waterwegen wilhelminakanaal en markkanaal tot
nl|stand zijn gekomen een belangrijke rol in dat proces speelde tilburg dat vanaf het eind
nl|van de achttiende eeuw ijverde voor de aanleg van een waterverbinding met dordrecht en rotterdam
nl|het gemeentebestuur werkte daarbij nauw samen met de lokale kamer van koophandel beide instanties waren
nl|ervan overtuigd dat de aanleg van een kanaal nodig was om de lokale economie voldoende
nl|te kunnen stimuleren in de eerste helft van de negentiende eeuw steunden opeenvolgende koningen het
nl|tilburgse streven echter zonder resultaat in het midden van die eeuw ontplooiden meerdere particulieren het
nl|initiatief om een kanaal naar tilburg te realiseren maar ook zij bleven zonder resultaat na
nl|werd het kanaal onderwerp van overheidsplannen technische en financi le problemen zaten succes in de
nl|weg daarnaast werd besluitvorming geblokkeerd door voortdurend terugkerende discussies over de vraag wie verantwoordelijk was
nl|voor de aanleg en het onderhoud de provincie of het rijk het duurde tot voordat
nl|de wet op het wilhelminakanaal afgekondigd werd in begon de daadwerkelijke aanleg van het kanaal
nl|die vaak vertraging ondervond ten gevolge van de eerste wereldoorlog eerst werd het gedeelte van
nl|de amer en de mark naar tilburg aangelegd die stad werd in over het kanaal
nl|bereikbaar wat feestelijk werd gevierd aan het tweede traject van de zuid willemsvaart naar tilburg
nl|werd begonnen in de openstelling van het kanaal vond plaats in tilburg was medio achttiende
nl|eeuw een belangrijk centrum van wolindustrie de stad was in die tijd slecht bereikbaar vervoer
nl|vond plaats met paard en wagen over vaak slecht begaanbare zandwegen van en naar de
nl|havens van breda s hertogenbosch en antwerpen of nabijgelegen kleinere havens in oosterhout en waalwijk
nl|de slechte bereikbaarheid vormde een belemmering voor de groei van de wolindustrie en betekende ook
nl|dat het onbetaalbaar was om meststoffen aan te voeren waaraan grote behoefte bestond gesteund door
nl|de plaatselijke kamer van koophandel streefde het stadsbestuur van tilburg naar de aanleg van een
nl|scheepvaartverbinding die zou leiden tot goedkoper vervoer van tilburgse producten naar binnen en buitenlandse afnemers
nl|tot goedkopere aanvoer van ruwe wol en steenkool en tot een betaalbare aanvoer van meststoffen
nl|waarmee ontginning van uitgebreide gebieden mogelijk zou worden de inspanningen van tilburg leken aan het
nl|eind van de achttiende eeuw succesvol zoals blijkt uit de oudste vermelding van plannen voor
nl|een kanaal bij tilburg in een almanak uit staat te lezen tilburg kreicht een voart
nl|want in de hijden aan de sandtweg naar breda ter plaatse de warand staan groote
nl|zware bessems het onderstboven tilburg krijgt een kanaal want in de heide langs de zandweg
nl|naar breda ter hoogte van de warande staan grote zware bezems ondersteboven in de grond
nl|tijdens de franse veldtocht in de nederlanden sloegen franse troepen in hun kamp op ten
nl|westen van de warande op de plaats waar de haven zou komen in afwachting van
nl|de verovering van heel nederland in de daarop volgende politieke ontwikkelingen sneuvelde het kanaalplan koning
nl|lodewijk napoleon deed tijdens zijn bezoek aan tilburg op april de toezegging aan burgemeester m
nl|c van dooren dat hij de mogelijkheid van een kanaal zou laten onderzoeken maar na
nl|zijn aftreden in vond deze belofte geen vervolg een volgende toezegging kwam van koning willem
nl|i die de stad bezocht op juni enkele weken later gaf hij opdracht om een
nl|waterweg te ontwerpen die tilburg verbond met s gravenmoer de belgische revolutie van betekende het
nl|einde voor dit plan een derde kans dacht de stad te krijgen van koning willem
nl|ii die in de buurt van tilburg veel woeste gronden bezat graag in de stad
nl|verbleef en er een paleis liet bouwen hij gaf in opdracht aan genieofficier ir j
nl|e duijven om een plan te ontwerpen voor een kanaal van tilburg naar het bevaarbare
nl|deel van de donge in februari werd begonnen met de aanleg als gevolg van de
nl|politieke ontwikkelingen die de koning deden vrezen voor zijn troon werd het werk korte tijd
nl|later stilgelegd tijdens een bezoek in maart aan tilburg overleed de koning de werkzaamheden werden
nl|niet hervat medio jaren meldde de tilburgse kamer van koophandel dat de jaarlijkse goederenaanvoer in
nl|de stad was gegroeid tot bijna miljoen kilo steenkool kilo ruwe wol kilo zout en
nl|ongeveer miljoen kilo andere artikelen zoals granen verfstoffen koloniale waren en manufacturen alleen al het
nl|transport van steenkool besloeg ruim karrevrachten die vanaf turnhout naar tilburg gereden werden de aanleg
nl|van verharde wegen in de eerste helft van de negentiende eeuw had weliswaar voor een
nl|verbetering van de vervoersmogelijkheden gezorgd maar de situatie bleef naar de mening van de tilburgse
nl|gemeente en kamer van koophandel een belemmering voor de gewenste industri le ontwikkeling in die
nl|tijd werd de aanleg en exploitatie van kanalen en spoorlijnen veelal overgelaten aan particuliere ondernemingen
nl|deze konden daartoe bij de overheid een concessie aanvragen in de jaren werden meerdere plannen
nl|ontworpen voor kanalen die tilburg bereikbaar maakten voor scheepvaart het eerste kwam van de eindhovense
nl|ingenieur willem christiaan brade op juni stuurde brade aan een aantal gemeenten in noord brabant
nl|en limburg een circulaire waarin hij een plan voorlegde voor een besproeijings en scheepvaart kanaal
nl|van de maas bij wessem tot de schelde bij nispen het plan voorzag in zijtakken
nl|die onder meer tilburg bereikbaar zouden maken voor scheepvaart het initiatief kreeg onvoldoende steun om
nl|tot ontwikkeling te komen een tweede plan werd opgesteld door oud generaal majoor j e
nl|van gorkum op april publiceerde hij een brochure gericht aan de koning waarin hij voorstelde
nl|een kanaal aan te leggen van venlo via tilburg naar bergen op zoom dat kanaal
nl|zou vier doelen dienen versterking van de landsverdediging ontginning van woeste gronden verbetering van de
nl|afwatering en bevordering van handel en transport van gorkum diende twee maal een aanvraag in
nl|voor een concessie in en beide werden afgewezen veelbelovender was het plan van de tilburgsche
nl|kanaal en vloeiweiden maatschappij stuwende kracht achter dit initiatief was j e duijven die met
nl|steun van tilburg het plan oppakte dat hij destijds voor koning willem ii had gemaakt
nl|en waarvan de aanleg in was stilgelegd hij paste het trac nu zo aan dat
nl|het niet ophield aan de laaggelegen rand van het tilburgs grondgebied maar doorliep tot in
nl|de veel hoger gelegen stad om de hoogteverschillen te overbruggen had duijven zes sluizen nodig
nl|en tien bruggen het plan voorzag in een zijtak naar riel die was bedoeld om
nl|het water uit de donge en de leij te ontsluiten om vloeiweiden te bevloeien en
nl|om het kanaal naar tilburg te vullen en gevuld te houden het kanaal werd begroot
nl|op gulden in kreeg duijven een voorlopige concessie voor de aanleg omdat toezeggingen vanuit tilburg
nl|onvoldoende dekking boden legde duijven contact met amsterdamse financiers het project kampte echter met technische
nl|en financi le tegenslagen de watertoevoer bleek een probleem en de groeiende vraag naar financiering
nl|van aan te leggen spoorweglijnen leidde tot een dalende interesse van beleggers in kanaalwegen uiteindelijk
nl|kwam het plan niet tot uitvoering eind jaren diende j van de griendt oprichter van
nl|maatschappij helenaveen een plan in voor een kanaal vanuit de zuid willemsvaart naar tilburg van
nl|de griendt tevens lid van de provinciale staten van noord brabant zei drie doelstellingen te
nl|willen realiseren het oplossen van het afvalwaterprobleem van de tilburgse wolindustrie het aansluiten van tilburg
nl|op scheepvaartverbindingen en het mogelijk maken van ontginningen langs het kanaal tilburg reageerde aanvankelijk sceptisch
nl|omdat van de griendt het vervolgtraject van tilburg naar dongen dat voor tilburg van essentieel
nl|belang was pas in een latere fase wilde uitwerken van de griendt werd ervan verdacht
nl|er alleen op uit te zijn turf te kunnen leveren aan de tilburgse industrie die
nl|was echter aan het overschakelen naar stoommachines en had daarom vooral behoefte aan steenkool in
nl|plaats van turf onder druk van zowel de gemeenteraad als de kamer van koophandel besloot
nl|het gemeentebestuur van tilburg toch mee te werken aan het voorstel van van de griendt
nl|waarop de provinciale staten in geld uittrokken om het plan te bestuderen rijkswaterstaat kreeg opdracht
nl|twee varianten van een kanaal naar tilburg te bestuderen die als mogelijk haalbaar werden beschouwd
nl|het betrof het trac van van de griendt dat vertrok vanuit de zuid willemsvaart bij
nl|aarle rixtel en een trac vanuit het eindhovensch kanaal in juni rapporteerde rijkswaterstaat de uitslag
nl|van het onderzoek waaruit bleek dat beide trac s realiseerbaar waren wel was de eindhovense
nl|variant aanmerkelijk duurder aansluitend stelden de noord brabantse staten op oktober een commissie in die
nl|het rapport moest uitwerken en een trac moest voorstellen dat de voorkeur verdiende het was
nl|geen vaste maar een zogeheten bijzondere commissie bestaande uit drie leden van de provinciale staten
nl|onder wie van de griendt de commissie kwam in met een ontwerp waarin gekozen werd
nl|voor een variant die vertrok vanuit de zuid willemsvaart het traject week af van het
nl|plan van de griend het vertrok vanuit erp en liep van daaruit langs de zuidzijde
nl|van sint oedenrode passeerde best en oirschot aan de noordzijde ging vandaar langs de zuidkant
nl|van tilburg en mondde uit in het oude maasje bij waspik de bodemdiepte bedroeg meter
nl|bij een breedte van meter met meter brede jaagpaden het kanaal zou bijna kilometer lang
nl|zijn met vier sluizen om het verval van meter te overbruggen het was begroot op
nl|gulden en de indieners gingen ervan uit dat de provincie een derde van de kosten
nl|zou dragen de overige kosten kwamen dan voor rekening van het rijk en de gemeenten
nl|die aan het trac grensden het plan werd weliswaar positief ontvangen maar het lukte om
nl|meerdere redenen niet om het te realiseren een van de problemen was dat het rijk
nl|en de provincie het er lange tijd niet over eens konden worden wie van beide
nl|de eindverantwoordelijkheid zou dragen voor de aanleg en het onderhoud een probleem dat daarmee samenhing
nl|was de financiering burgemeester j f jansen van tilburg nam het initiatief om een maatschappij
nl|op te richten waarin de betrokken gemeenten via aandelen konden deelnemen zelf kondigde hij aan
nl|dat tilburg gulden zou bijdragen andere gemeenten zegden bijdragen toe van in totaal ruim gulden
nl|enkele gemeenten boden aan de benodigde gronden op hun gebied gratis ter beschikking te stellen
nl|in juli constateerde de bijzondere commissie echter dat de toezeggingen van betrokken gemeenten ontoereikend waren
nl|om tot een concreet plan van uitvoering te komen bovendien hadden sommige gemeenten hun toezegging
nl|gedaan onder voorwaarden die onaanvaardbaar werden geacht burgemeester jansen realiseerde zich al voor de bijzondere
nl|commissie haar rapport uitbracht dat het niet zou lukken de financiering van ruim miljoen gulden
nl|rond te krijgen in een ingezonden brief die op maart gepubliceerd werd in de tilburgsche
nl|courant pleitte hij nogmaals voor de aanleg van een kanaal dat tilburg inmiddels was aangesloten
nl|op het spoorwegnet gaf onvoldoende soelaas naar de mening van de burgemeester waren spoorwegen onmisbaar
nl|voor elke plaats die handel wil drijven maar waren waterwegen de goedkoopste vervoermiddelen en daarom
nl|onmisbaar voor elke plaats die haar industrie wil uitbreiden hij pleitte ervoor om niet langer
nl|te wachten maar te kiezen voor een korter kanaal vanaf de zuid willemsvaart tot aan
nl|tilburg zo n kanaal zou gulden kosten en aan de belangrijkste wensen van de industriestad
nl|voldoen het initiatief werd overgenomen door de gemeenteraad van tilburg die stelde als voorwaarde dat
nl|industri len handelaren en andere betrokkenen een bedrag van gulden zouden bijeenbrengen en uitlenen aan
nl|de gemeente op maart werd in een speciaal belegde bijeenkomst de mogelijkheid gegeven op de
nl|lening in te tekenen in de gemeenteraadsvergadering van april bleek dat slechts was ingeschreven voor
nl|iets meer dan gulden de burgemeester constateerde dat het gemeentebestuur er alles aan had gedaan
nl|om het kanaal mogelijk te maken en kondigde aan dat het bestuur zijn taak in
nl|dezen neerlegde een ander probleem dat uitvoering van het plan uit belemmerde was dat er
nl|steeds alternatieve trac s werden voorgesteld die als ze serieus bevonden werden door de ingenieurs
nl|van rijkswaterstaat moesten worden doorgerekend de provinciale staten namen in het besluit een eigen waterstaatsdienst
nl|op te richten en trokken ir f c bake aan als hoofdingenieur de nieuwe dienst
nl|trad in werking op april en een van de eerste opdrachten die bake kreeg was
nl|het ontwerpen van een scheepvaartkanaal vanuit het eindhovensch kanaal naar tilburg het moest een kanaal
nl|worden met klein profiel dat zou worden aangelegd en onderhouden door tilburg de bijzondere commissie
nl|agendeerde het ontwerp van bake in de zomervergadering van de provinciale staten van juni het
nl|voorstel werd aangehouden voor nadere meningsvorming in juli werd het voorstel opnieuw besproken tijdens de
nl|discussie opperden acht leden van de provinciale staten een geheel ander trac als mogelijkheid onder
nl|aanvoering van j f pompen bepleitten zij een kanaal met breed profiel vanaf venlo via
nl|helmond eindhoven tilburg en breda naar het hollandsch diep toen na de discussie moest worden
nl|gestemd werd het ontwerp van bake verworpen met tegen stemmen bake adviseerde de provinciale staten
nl|om het alternatieve trac van pompen en zijn medestanders stapsgewijs te onderzoeken te beginnen bij
nl|het traject zuid willemsvaart oirschot de staten namen zijn voorstel over bij de uitwerking van
nl|het plan pompen koos bake voor een verbinding van venlo naar de zuid willemsvaart bij
nl|nederweert en vanaf de zuid willemsvaart tussen sluis en bij aarle rixtel langs lieshout breugel
nl|son best oirschot moergestel tilburg dongen oosterhout terheijden en vandaar naar het hollandsch diep met
nl|een zijtak van terheijden naar breda de bijzondere commissie stelde het plan voor aan de
nl|provinciale staten in de vergadering van november met enkele kleine trajectwijzigingen werd het voorstel met
nl|tegen stemmen aangenomen uit de provinciale kas werd miljoen gulden beschikbaar gesteld als subsidie onder
nl|voorwaarde dat het rijk verantwoordelijk zou zijn voor aanleg en onderhoud en dat betrokken gemeenten
nl|gulden zouden bijdragen minister j p r tak van poortvliet van waterstaat liet weten niet
nl|genegen te zijn het werk van rijkswege uit te voeren even leek er in de
nl|tweede kamer een oplossing in zicht te komen voor een kanaal naar tilburg in bracht
nl|minister tak van poortvliet de kanalenwet in stemming de wet betrof de aanleg en verbetering
nl|van een vijftiental vaarwegen verspreid over nederland in het tweede artikel van de wet werd
nl|onder meer een tegemoetkoming uit de schatkist in het vooruitzicht gesteld voor de aanleg en
nl|het onderhoud van een kanaal van eindhoven langs tilburg naar de amer de kamer verwierp
nl|het gehele wetsvoorstel op mei met tegen stemmen tak van poortvliet bood daarop zijn ontslag
nl|aan maar zijn opvolger g j g klerck wist in de jaren toch veel van
nl|de voorstellen uit de kanalenwet aangenomen te krijgen de werkzaamheden aan het aangekondigde kanaal in
nl|noord brabant waren in de voorstellen van klerck echter pas voorzien in het eerste kwart
nl|van de twintigste eeuw in juli stelden de provinciale staten gulden beschikbaar voor een studie
nl|naar te graven kanalen een klein jaar later in juni presenteerde bake zijn plan hij
nl|had zijn ontwerp uit enigszins aangepast waardoor het traject nu liep vanaf de zuid willemsvaart
nl|bij aarle rixtel tussen sluis en door de gemeenten lieshout nuenen c a son c
nl|a best oirschot oostelbeers c a diessen hilvarenbeek tilburg gilze rijen en dongen naar oosterhout
nl|bij oosterhout was een zijtak voorzien naar de mark het kanaal kreeg een dubbele keersluis
nl|nabij de zuid willemsvaart twee gewone en twee dubbele sluizen in het traject haghorst oosterhout
nl|en een keersluis in de mark bake werkte waar mogelijk met vaste bruggen met op
nl|en afritten in totaal in het hoofdkanaal en vier in de zijtak bij het kruisen
nl|van spoorwegen koos hij voor een draaibrug en waar dat onmogelijk was voor een hydraulische
nl|hefbrug de twaalf riviertjes die gekruist moesten worden leidde hij met duikers onder het kanaal
nl|door om het kanaal van water te voorzien en waterverlies door verdamping wegsijpelen en schutten
nl|aan te vullen dacht bake aan voeding vanuit de zuid willemsvaart als dat op bezwaren
nl|zou stuiten zou het oppompen van water uit de dommel een alternatieve mogelijkheid zijn bake
nl|begrootte de totale kosten onteigeningen graafwerkzaamheden en kunstwerken als sluizen bruggen en duikers op gulden
nl|op april bepleitte een afvaardiging van de provinciale staten aangevuld met bake de aanleg van
nl|het kanaal in het ministerie van waterstaat handel en nijverheid het ministerie twijfelde aan de
nl|betrouwbaarheid van de opties die bake noemde voor de voeding water dat aan de zuid
nl|willemsvaart onttrokken zou worden moest worden aangevuld door extra water uit de maas af te
nl|tappen er moest rekening mee worden gehouden dat belgi daar onder verwijzing naar het maastraktaat
nl|uit geen toestemming voor zou geven oppompen van water uit de dommel leek riskant omdat
nl|wateraanvoer vanuit die rivier onbetrouwbaar was en zou kunnen leiden tot schadeclaims van de vele
nl|eigenaren van watermolens langs de dommel de provincie kondigde aan de bezwaren van het ministerie
nl|nader te gaan onderzoeken het duurde enkele jaren voor het ontwerp zodanig was aangepast dat
nl|de technische twijfels van het ministerie waren weggenomen na het overlijden van bake in nam
nl|zijn opvolger h van schevichaven de leiding over van de commissie die de voeding moest
nl|onderzoeken de commissie koos voor het oppompen van water uit de dommel waartoe bij son
nl|een stoomgemaal moest worden gebouwd inmiddels was het dwarsprofiel van de zuid willemsvaart die ook
nl|voor het kanaal naar tilburg werd voorzien gewijzigd de breedte was vergroot van naar meter
nl|en de diepte van naar meter besloten werd het profiel niet aan te passen maar
nl|met de onteigeningsbreedte en de doorvaartwijdte van bruggen rekening te houden met toekomstige aanpassingen verder
nl|bleek een bijstelling van het trac nodig te zijn om tilburg aan de noordzijde te
nl|kunnen passeren de kostenraming steeg naar miljoen gulden exclusief de aanleg van het stoomgemaal de
nl|provinciale staten keurden het aangepaste plan bake op juli goed de belanghebbende gemeenten hadden gezamenlijk

nl|voor de goedkeuring van het plan was dat het rijk de aanleg en het onderhoud
nl|voor zijn rekening zou nemen op juli stuurde de provincie noord brabant een voorstel aan
nl|minister p w van der sleijden met daarin het aangepaste plan bake met toelichtingen op
nl|de gekozen technische oplossingen enkele maanden na de indiening van het voorstel werd een lobby
nl|gestart waarin de naam wilhelmina kanaal werd ge ntroduceerd de eerste actie was een ingezonden
nl|opiniestuk op september in dagblad de tijd het artikel stond prominent linksboven op de voorpagina
nl|en besloeg bijna twee kolommen de inzender van wie de naam niet vermeld werd feliciteerde
nl|de provinciale staten van noord brabant met het besluit om aan de willemsvaart een wilhelminavaart
nl|te verbinden gevolgd door een pleidooi waarin de regering werd opgeroepen het voorstel spoedig te
nl|behandelen het stuk eindigde met de wens moge weldra de eerste spade worden gestoken voor
nl|het ontworpen wilhelmina kanaal de dag daarop verscheen hetzelfde stuk als redactionele bijdrage in de
nl|tilburgsche courant en enkele dagen later werd het met bronvermelding overgenomen door de krant zuidwillemsvaart
nl|de actie werd een tijd later opgevolgd door het tilburgse gemeentebestuur burgemeester jansen en secretaris
nl|van der marck stuurden op april een brief aan minister van der sleijden met afschriften
nl|aan de leden van de eerste en tweede kamer de provinciale staten en de belanghebbende
nl|gemeenten waarin ze zich beklaagden over het voortdurend uitblijven van een besluit tot aanleg van
nl|het kanaal aan het eind van hun brief spraken zij de verwachting uit dat het
nl|wilhelminakanaal een der eerste groote werken zal zijn die onder de regeering onzer geliefde koningin
nl|wilhelmina worden tot stand gebracht het is moeilijk te beoordelen of die naamgeving bijgedragen heeft
nl|aan het uiteindelijke succes van het streven naar een kanaal voor tilburg maar zeker is
nl|dat de aanduiding wilhelminakanaal enkele jaren later bij noord brabantse provinciale organisaties algemeen gebruikt werd
nl|in oktober liet minister van der sleijden weten dat de hoofdingenieur van rijkswaterstaat na bestudering
nl|van het kanaalontwerp had gerapporteerd dat hij geen technische bezwaren had tegen het plan de
nl|minister kon echter geen uitzicht geven op aanleg en onderhoud van het kanaal door het
nl|rijk mocht de provincie die taken op zich nemen dan zou nader overwogen worden in
nl|welke mate het rijk in de kosten kon bijdragen naast financi le redenen speelde bij
nl|de afwijzing mee dat van der sleijden een civiel ingenieur die afkomstig was van rijkswaterstaat
nl|zelf twijfelde aan de haalbaarheid van het kanaal hij vond de wateraanvoer uit de dommel
nl|onbetrouwbaar en was bang dat er bij aarle rixtel ondanks een belgisch verbod toch water
nl|uit de zuid willemsvaart afgetapt zou worden daarnaast zag hij vooral de kruising van het
nl|ontworpen kanaal met de dommel waar het kanaal meter hoger zou liggen dan de rivier
nl|als een technisch probleem op juli volgde c lely minister van der sleijden op enkele
nl|maanden na de benoeming peilde hij of tilburg bereid zou zijn financieel bij te dragen
nl|aan een kanaal dat beperkt bleef tot het traject tilburg amer in een audi ntie
nl|die de gemeenteraad had aangevraagd legde burgemeester jansen aan de minister uit dat een verbinding
nl|met de zuid willemsvaart voor tilburg van groot belang was het zou de tilburgse industrie
nl|een scheepvaartverbinding geven met het luiks steenkoolbekken vervoer van steenkool over water was beduidend goedkoper
nl|dan via een spoorwegverbinding de gemeenteraad van tilburg reageerde hoopvol op de positieve reacties van
nl|de minister maar die hoop werd getemperd toen de minister in oktober meldde dat hij
nl|met besluitvorming wachtte tot de technische bezwaren die bij het ministerie nog steeds bestonden zouden
nl|zijn opgelost twee jaar later leken de provincie en het ministerie het eens te zijn
nl|de provinciale staten stelden op november opnieuw vast dat miljoen gulden aan het kanaal zou
nl|worden besteed verder besloten de staten dat de provincie de kosten van het oppompen van
nl|water uit de dommel voor haar rekening zou nemen inclusief het schadeloos stellen van eigenaars
nl|van watermolens en het aanleggen van een stuw uitgangspunten waren echter dat de regering verantwoordelijk
nl|zou zijn voor aanleg en onderhoud van het kanaal en bovendien zorg zou dragen voor
nl|het gebruik van het kanaal voor de irrigatie van landbouwgebieden lely was daartoe bereid en
nl|liet zijn ministerie een wetsontwerp voorbereiden in december maakte hij het wetsvoorstel aanhangig bij de
nl|raad van state de opmerkingen van de raad van state en het ongevraagd advies van
nl|een hoofdambtenaar waren voor lely aanleiding om in maart een nieuw onderzoek te starten provinciale
nl|waterstaat noord brabant rijkswaterstaat en de raad van toezicht op de spoorwegdiensten kregen gezamenlijk de
nl|opdracht na te gaan of de begroting van het kanaal die al tien jaar oud
nl|was nog geldig was met name de stadsuitbreidingen van tilburg de sterke groei van het
nl|spoorwegverkeer met steeds zwaardere stoomlocomotieven en de gestegen kosten van lonen en materialen waren in
nl|niet te voorzien geweest op augustus werd lely opgevolgd door j c de marez oyens
nl|het onderzoek was nog niet afgesloten maar geruchten die de nieuwe minister hoorde over het
nl|verloop ervan deden hem besluiten het wetsontwerp van lely terug te trekken de teleurstelling in
nl|noord brabant was groot in de tweede kamer stelde een afgevaardigde uit breda dat het
nl|rijk miljoen gulden had besteed aan het noordzeekanaal miljoen aan de rotterdamsche waterweg en miljoen
nl|aan het merwedekanaal en dat het daarom alleszins gerechtvaardigd was miljoen gulden uit te trekken
nl|voor noord brabant in de discussie legde de marez oyens gesteund door lely die inmiddels
nl|kamerlid was uit wat de motieven van hem en van lely waren geweest die geleid
nl|hadden tot de besluiten die ter discussie werden gesteld hij kon onmogelijk een toezegging geven
nl|en kondigde een nieuw onderzoek aan naar de voeding van het kanaal omdat hij eraan
nl|twijfelde of het kanaal voldoende water zou hebben het nieuwe onderzoek werd gecombineerd met het
nl|onderzoek dat lely gestart had in november hadden de hoofdingenieurs van provinciale waterstaat en rijkswaterstaat
nl|de update van het plan bake klaar de wijzigingen waren nogal ingrijpend in tilburg werd
nl|het trac om de inmiddels sterk uitgebreide bebouwde kom heen gelegd en werden twee zijkanalen
nl|gepland beide met een haven bij oosterhout moesten de sluizen geheel anders geplaatst worden omdat
nl|de situering ten opzichte van de oude oosterhoutse haven diende te veranderen en omdat rekening
nl|gehouden moest worden met de sterk wisselende watertoevoer op de mark daarnaast kreeg het kanaal
nl|toch hetzelfde profiel als de zuid willemsvaart meter breed en meter diep waardoor er beweegbare
nl|bruggen moesten komen de keersluis bij de zuid willemsvaart werd vervangen door een dubbele schutsluis
nl|ten slotte werd de als problematisch beoordeelde voeding van het kanaal door een stoomgemaal bij
nl|son vervangen door een reeks elektrische gemalen bij de sluizen die water vanuit de amer
nl|oppompten naar de hoger gelegen gedeelten van het kanaal de kostenraming steeg van miljoen naar
nl|miljoen gulden het kanaalplan werd besproken in een bijzondere vergadering van de provinciale staten op
nl|februari er lag een voorstel om miljoen gulden uit de provinciale kas bij te dragen
nl|aan het kanaal en om samen met de betrokken gemeenten te zorgen voor het gratis
nl|ter beschikking stellen van de benodigde grond een voorwaarde was wel dat het rijk zou
nl|zorgen voor de aanleg en het onderhoud een groep statenleden diende echter een motie in
nl|waarin gevraagd werd eerst samen met het ministerie een onderzoek in te stellen naar een
nl|trac met een ombuiging naar eindhoven aan die motie was een eindhovense lobby voorafgegaan die
nl|gevoerd werd door de burgemeester de kamer van koophandel en een aantal industri len even
nl|leek het erop dat de totstandkoming van het kanaal opnieuw vertraagd zou worden maar de
nl|motie werd met tegen stemmen verworpen het voorstel om de subsidie van miljoen toe te
nl|kennen werd vervolgens aangenomen met tegen stemmen eind diende minister de marez oyens een wetsontwerp
nl|in tot aanleg van het kanaal door het rijk de tweede kamer behandelde het ontwerp
nl|in mei en nam het op juni aan op juni werd de wet van den
nl|den juni tot aanleg van een scheepvaartkanaal ter verbinding van de zuid willemsvaart en de
nl|rivier de mark onderling en met de rivier de amer afgekondigd in het staatsblad van
nl|het koninkrijk der nederlanden nummer de vreugde over de wet werd in noord brabant enigszins
nl|getemperd toen bleek dat de kamer wel besloten had dat het kanaal er zou komen
nl|maar niet wanneer in de toelichting had de minister gesteld dat belangrijke uitgaven voor de
nl|aanleg van het kanaal pas gedaan zouden kunnen worden als er geen uitgaven meer nodig
nl|waren voor de grote werken die het rijk onderhanden had twee maanden later op augustus
nl|eindigde het ministerschap van de marez oyens hij werd opgevolgd door j kraus die op
nl|februari met koninklijke machtiging bepaalde dat het kanaal de naam van wilhelminakanaal zou dragen a
nl|kraus trok evenals zijn opvolgers j g s bevers en l h w regout wel
nl|geld uit voor de kanaalaanleg maar omdat de grote werken nog niet afgerond waren niet
nl|genoeg om daadwerkelijk aan de slag te kunnen gaan een van de bijkomende problemen was
nl|dat de gemeenten wel hun eigen grond gratis aanboden maar dat veel van de benodigde
nl|percelen niet hun eigendom waren uiteindelijk beloofde regout een meer krachtige voortzetting der werken zodra
nl|een daartoe strekkende onteigeningswet zou zijn aangenomen die wet werd op februari gepubliceerd in staatsblad
nl|nummer en op december vond inderdaad de eerste aanbesteding plaats op januari opende rijkswaterstaat in
nl|tilburg het bureau aanleg wilhelminakanaal met als hoofd ir c l schuller tot peursum het
nl|bureau had onder andere als taak het maken van de bouwtekeningen en het opstellen van
nl|de bestekken voor het uitgraven van het kanaal met daarin grondduikers sluizen en bruggen alsook
nl|voor beschoeiingen dijken bermsloten meerpalen remmingwerken landhoofden en gebouwen loskades waren niet voorzien in het
nl|plan van aanleg maar konden worden aangevraagd door gemeenten of particulieren er was ministeri le
nl|vergunning voor nodig en de benodigde tekeningen en het bestek werden op kosten van de
nl|aanvrager gemaakt door rijkswaterstaat het bureau was ook verantwoordelijk voor het toezicht op de werkzaamheden
nl|de opzichters leverden elke maand een gedetailleerde voortgangsrapportage in met gegevens over onder meer het
nl|verrichte werk welk werk was uitgezet en welke aannemer de projecten had aangenomen het bureauhoofd
nl|rapporteerde de voortgang aan de dienst rijkswaterstaat voor den aanleg van het wilhelminakanaal te s
nl|hertogenbosch in de uitwerking van het ontwerp verdeelde het bureau het kanaal in twee delen
nl|het hoofdkanaal en het kanaal naar de mark het hoofdkanaal telde vijf zogeheten panden die
nl|begrensd werden door sluizen ze werden genummerd vanaf de donge aanvankelijk werd daarvoor het gebruikelijke
nl|arabisch indische cijfersysteem gebruikt maar om verwarring met de nummering van de sluizen van de
nl|zuid willemsvaart te vermijden werd overgegaan naar romeinse cijfers de sluizen en gemalen kregen het
nl|nummer van het zogeheten benedenste pand nadere gegevens over de kanaaldelen zijn aangegeven in onderstaande
nl|tabel schuller tot peursum ori nteerde zich bij zijn werk op nieuwe technologie n zijn
nl|belangstelling ging daarbij uit naar elektriciteit als energiebron en gewapend beton als bouwmateriaal twee innovaties
nl|die in de tweede helft van de negentiende eeuw ge ntroduceerd waren en begin twintigste
nl|eeuw een stormachtige groei doormaakten in maakte hij een daagse reis naar duitsland waar hij
nl|zich liet voorlichten over het ontwerp en de aanleg van het oder spreekanaal uit het
nl|dortmund eemskanaal uit en het teltowkanaal uit het eerste kanaal was circa kilometer lang en
nl|werd aangelegd in vijf jaar tijd bij het tweede was veel graafwerk machinaal verricht en
nl|bij laatste kanaal waren elektrisch bediende sluizen aangelegd waartoe ter plaatse elektriciteit werd opgewekt schuller
nl|tot peursum leidde het bureau tot augustus hij werd opgevolgd door ir j c schaap
nl|die op september in dienst trad en in functie bleef tot het bureau in april
nl|werd opgeheven een van de eerste taken van het bureau was het voorbereiden van de
nl|onteigeningen in was het opmeten in volle gang en werden de eerste piketpalen geslagen datzelfde
nl|jaar werden de plannen in de betrokken gemeenten ter visie gelegd gevolgd door hoorzittingen waarin
nl|bezwaren konden worden toegelicht in augustus ontving schuller tot peursum een brief waarin het ministerie
nl|er bezwaar tegen maakte dat schatters al benoemd werden voordat de onteigeningswet was aangenomen toen
nl|dat begin wel het geval was volgde een tweede ronde met tervisieleggingen en in mei
nl|was het overzicht van de te onteigenen percelen klaar ze besloegen in totaal hectare waarvan
nl|hectare kosteloos werd afgestaan door de betrokken gemeenten de andere hectare lagen verdeeld over zo
nl|n percelen die eigendom waren van in totaal personen de onteigeningen liepen vertragingen op door
nl|meerdere oorzaken een daarvan was dat de gemeente eindhoven in een nieuwe vergeefse poging deed
nl|het trac meer zuidelijk te laten verlopen de minister was gedwongen die suggestie te onderzoeken
nl|waarop de onteigeningen in het oostelijk deel van het traject tijdelijk werden stopgezet een ander
nl|probleem was dat de taxateurs de waardestijging van de percelen meenamen de inspectie accepteerde dat
nl|niet omdat de onteigeningswet dat verbood uiteindelijk hakte minister regout in de knoop door om
nl|verdere vertraging te voorkomen bepaalde hij dat de te hoge taxaties alsnog geaccepteerd werden de
nl|onteigeningen kwamen daardoor in een versnelling en vrijwel alle percelen werden in der minne aangekocht
nl|slechts in gevallen volgde een gerechtelijke procedure en uiteindelijk kostte het vier jaar om deze
nl|af te ronden de totale kosten van de onteigening kwamen uit op bijna miljoen gulden
nl|de sluizen van het wilhelminakanaal zijn ontworpen door schuller tot peursum hij gebruikte daarbij gewapend
nl|beton alleen in de funderingen op andere plaatsen bleef hij trouw aan het traditionele metselwerk
nl|schuller koos voor bajonetsluizen wat inhoudt dat het schip dat als eerste de sluiskolk binnen
nl|vaart ook weer als eerste de sluis verlaat de omvang van de schutkolken stemde hij
nl|af op het toen gangbare type binnenvaartschip de kempenaar dat maximaal meter lang en meter
nl|breed is om het grote verval bij oosterhout en tilburg op te vangen rustte hij
nl|sluis i en iii uit met twee schutkolken die via een tussensluishoofd met elkaar in
nl|verbinding stonden en zo een dubbele schuthoogte konden overbruggen op de sluisterreinen was een elektriciteitsvoorziening
nl|nodig omdat de gemalen overeenkomstig het ge pdate plan bake uit uitgerust moesten worden met
nl|elektromotoren schuller legde contractueel vast dat de elektriciteit zou worden geleverd door de in aanbouw
nl|zijnde dongecentrale te geertruidenberg hij besloot maximaal gebruik te maken van die krachtbron en elektrificeerde
nl|ook de bediening van de sluisdeuren evenals die van het omloopriool dat diende voor het
nl|vullen en ledigen van de kolken en voor de voeding van het kanaal de gebouwen
nl|de terreinen en de seinen voor de scheepvaart kregen elektrische verlichting bij elk van de
nl|sluizen i tot en met iv was in de plannen een gemaal voorzien dat er
nl|in geval van watertekort voor moest zorgen dat het water in het hoger gelegen pand
nl|op peil bleef de vrijwel identieke gemalen werden ontworpen door ingenieursbureau j van hasselt de
nl|koning zowel de gebouwen als de daarin te plaatsen installaties de gebouwen kregen een betonnen
nl|pompkelder met daarin twee liggende centrifugaalpompen van machinefabriek jaffa direct aangedreven door draaistroom elektromotoren van
nl|smit slikkerveer deze werden verticaal opgesteld in de op de begane grond gelegen machineruimte in
nl|de tussenvloer boven de machineruimte werden de door heemaf vervaardigde schakelkasten en transformatoren geplaatst de
nl|gemalen werden gebouwd in de buurt van de schutsluizen aan het benedenpand van het kanaal
nl|het water dat uit het lage pand was opgepompt werd via een lange persleiding geloosd
nl|op het hoge pand de grondduikers in het kanaal waar de kruisende riviertjes doorheen konden
nl|lopen werden door schuller geheel ontworpen van gewapend beton ze werden zodanig aangelegd dat ze
nl|bochten afsneden opdat de riviertjes tijdens de bouw hun oude loop konden blijven volgen twee
nl|belangrijke duikers waren die onder de donge en de dommel de dongeduiker was de eerste
nl|die ontworpen werd en waarmee ervaring werd opgedaan de duiker kreeg een doorstromingsprofiel van m
nl|de constructie bestond uit een horizontale betonnen koker op een diepte van meter beneden de
nl|kanaalbodem met daarop een ellipsvormig gewelf de koker was meter lang meter breed en meter
nl|hoog het gewelf was meter hoog de dommelduiker door vele ingenieurs van rijkswaterstaat aanvankelijk voor
nl|onmogelijk gehouden was een van de laatste duikers die werd aangelegd deze duiker kreeg een
nl|voetplaat van meter lengte en meter breedte die werd gestort op een diepte van meter
nl|beneden de kanaalbodem hierop werden vijf gewelfde doorstroomopeningen gebouwd met een hoogte van meter en
nl|een breedte van meter bij de bouw werd ton betonijzer en m beton verwerkt de
nl|duiker werd voltooid in oktober enkele maanden na het vertrek van schuller schuller tot peursum
nl|paste vier brugmodellen toe waarbij de keuze voor een bepaald model vooral functioneel van aard
nl|was waar mogelijk koos hij voor ingeklemde boogbruggen van gewapend beton vanwege het sierlijke effect
nl|van deze lichte bruggen in het landschap het waren zuivere boogbruggen wat betekent dat het
nl|rijdek boven de bogen lag voor doorgaande wegen en wegen waarover een tram reed ontwierp
nl|schuller met de hand bediende draaibruggen met een sobere functionele vormgeving in secundaire wegen liet
nl|hij ophaalbruggen bouwen deze bruggen hadden eveneens handbediening en kregen een herkenbare uitvoering in staal
nl|met een houten wegdek de spoorbruggen bij tilburg en best liet schuller uitvoeren als stalen
nl|vakwerkbruggen de spoorbrug in tilburg kreeg vier bovenbouwen en die in best twee bij de
nl|in tilburg uit te voeren spoorwegwerkzaamheden behoorden ook vier viaducten in best werd een stalen
nl|vakwerkbrug gebouwd in de doorgaande weg s hertogenbosch eindhoven en in de verbinding met de
nl|bestse heide de achterliggende reden om hier af te wijken van het model betonnen boogbrug
nl|is niet bekend bij de eerst gebouwde boogbruggen in het kanaal naar de mark en
nl|in de panden i en ii ontstonden scheuren in de kolommen waarop het rijdek rustte
nl|en in de landhoofden schuller probeerde het probleem op te lossen door de wapening aan
nl|te passen en landhoofden en rijvloer in een keer te storten dit bleek niet afdoende
nl|waarna bij de laatste bruggen schotten werden toegepast in plaats van kolommen het graafwerk voor
nl|het wilhelminakanaal inclusief het aanleggen van dijken beschoeiingen en bermsloten werd deels machinaal en deels
nl|handmatig gedaan een belangrijke machine bij het graven was de excavateur een graafmachine met stoomaandrijving
nl|een excavateur met een graafladder van meter lengte kon per dag met de urige werkdag
nl|van die tijd ongeveer m grond ontgraven ter vergelijking een grondwerker groef handmatig per dag
nl|m af een andere machine was de stoomlocomotief die gebruikt werd om kiepkarren met uitgegraven
nl|grond te transporteren van plaatsen waar grond voor de dijkaanleg over was naar waar er
nl|een tekort aan was dat was bijvoorbeeld het geval op gedeelten waar het kanaal gedeeltelijk
nl|boven het maaiveld kwam te liggen waardoor er daar extra hoge dijken nodig waren beide
nl|machines stonden tijdens de laatste jaren van de eerste wereldoorlog van tijd tot tijd stil
nl|bij gebrek aan steenkool dat leidde tot vertragingen en extra kosten omdat meer werk handmatig
nl|moest worden verricht voor het handmatige grondwerk zetten de aannemers voornamelijk polderjongens in losse arbeiders
nl|die zich als groep verhuurden en van project naar project trokken vooral als er geen
nl|steenkool was en de machines stilstonden waren er honderden polderwerkers nodig van wie er veel
nl|uit het westelijk deel van noord brabant kwamen ze woonden tijdens hun werk in keten
nl|naast het kanaal hun overmatig drankgebruik leidde vaak tot overlast dat was onder meer het
nl|geval in lieshout waar veertien keten stonden waarin circa polderjongens gehuisvest waren in die gemeente
nl|liep het in zo uit de hand dat de veldwachters hun vuurwapens moesten gebruiken wat
nl|voor de burgemeester aanleiding was om politieversterking aan te vragen ook de burgemeester van son
nl|zag zich in genoodzaakt politieversterking in te roepen wegens wangedrag van dronken en ontevreden polderjongens
nl|polderjongens waren overigens niet de enigen die graaf en sjouwwerk verrichtten veel boeren die in
nl|de buurt van het kanaal woonden boden zich in de winter aan om zo wat
nl|bij te verdienen als de machines stil stonden wegens een tekort aan steenkool werden soms
nl|ook werklozen ingezet het bureau aanleg wilhelminakanaal had het werk aan het kanaal verdeeld over
nl|honderden bestekken waarop aannemers konden inschrijven hoewel ook lokale aannemers een bestek wisten binnen te
nl|halen trok een tiental gespecialiseerde landelijke aannemers en bouwmaatschappijen grote secties van het kanaal naar
nl|zich toe tijdens de werkzaamheden kregen de aannemers meerdere malen verlenging van de einddatum en
nl|verhoging van de aanneemsom vanwege de geleden oorlogsschade deze schade werd veroorzaakt door lange levertijden
nl|en prijsverhogingen van steenkool ijzer hardsteen en hout om tilburg zo snel mogelijk over water
nl|bereikbaar te maken werd besloten eerst de panden i tot en met iii vanuit de
nl|amer naar tilburg aan te leggen en pas in tweede instantie de panden iv en
nl|v van tilburg naar de zuid willemsvaart op december werd het eerste werk aanbesteed het
nl|betrof het baggeren van een vaargeul van kilometer in de donge en het graven van
nl|pand i van het hoofdkanaal de daadwerkelijke aanleg van het kanaal begon in met het
nl|op de gewenste diepte brengen van de donge het werk verliep voorspoedig en op mei
nl|kon oosterhout vanaf de amer over het wilheminakanaal bereikt worden op oktober vond de aanbesteding
nl|plaats van het graven van het kilometer lange kanaal naar de mark het uitdiepen van
nl|de mark en bijbehorende werken als de schutsluis en de bruggen vanaf oktober kon op
nl|het kanaal naar de mark en op de mark zelf gevaren worden waardoor breda bereikbaar
nl|was voor de scheepvaart in het hoofdkanaal werd in de loop van sluis i gebouwd
nl|en werd een aanvang gemaakt met het graven aan pand ii een jaar later volgden
nl|het graafwerk aan pand iii en het aanleggen van de sluizen ii en iii inclusief
nl|de andere kunstwerken in bereikte het door gemaal i uit de amer opgepompte water dongen
nl|waarmee die plaats over het kanaal bereikbaar was in liep de voortgang vertragingen op door
nl|tekorten aan steenkool voor de machines maar op februari kon ook de loswal aan het
nl|lijnsheike te tilburg worden aangesloten op het kanaal het kanaaltraject amer tilburg werd op april
nl|officieel geopend de genodigden onder wie de opperbevelhebber van land en zeemacht hoofdingenieurs van rijkswaterstaat
nl|tilburgse notabelen en leden van de eerste kamer tweede kamer en provinciale staten van noord
nl|brabant reisden per tram naar oosterhout en voeren na de lunch op twee gepavoiseerde schepen
nl|onder het genot van sherry en port naar tilburg onderweg werden de kunstwerken van het
nl|kanaal bezichtigd vanaf het lijnsheike vervoerden dertig auto s de genodigden naar het stadhuis daar
nl|werd in toespraken gevierd dat tilburg door de totstandkoming van het kanaal was verbonden met
nl|de grote vaarwegen van nederland en met geheel europa eind begonnen de voorbereidingen voor de
nl|aanleg van het oostelijk deel van het kanaal op december van dat jaar werd het
nl|eerste bestek aanbesteed het maken van drie boogbruggen twee grondduikers en een ophaalbrug in pand
nl|v onder aarle rixtel het werk begon op februari en werd voltooid op oktober inmiddels
nl|werd ook gewerkt aan de dommelduiker die in oktober werd opgeleverd met de aanleg van
nl|sluis v werd gestart op juli en op januari begonnen de graafwerkzaamheden in pand v
nl|vanuit de ingang van het kanaal tussen sluis en sluis van de zuid willemsvaart vanaf
nl|september in dat jaar stonden de excavateurs vaak stil door gebrek aan steenkool waardoor honderden
nl|polderjongens ingezet moesten worden begin was lieshout vanaf de zuid willemsvaart bereikbaar en een jaar
nl|later konden de schepen tot son doorvaren medio werd een begin gemaakt met de kanaalaanleg
nl|in pand iv dat liep van tilburg naar haghorst daarmee was sluis iv het laatste
nl|grote kunstwerk dat in uitvoering kwam het pand kwam in gereed op het op diepte
nl|uitbaggeren na gedurende het jaar werd het kanaalgedeelte van son tot voorbij oirschot op diepte
nl|gebaggerd begin werd als laatste het kanaalgedeelte van oirschot tot tilburg voltooid ondertussen waren ook
nl|het zijkanaal en de haven in tilburg gereed de gemalen hadden hun opdracht vervuld en
nl|de voeding van het kanaal kon worden overgenomen door water uit de zuid willemsvaart b
nl|het voltooide kanaal had een bodembreedte van meter en was meter breed aan de waterlijn
nl|met een waterdiepte van circa meter het kanaal had bruggen sluizen gemalen en grondduikers de
nl|gehele oever was versterkt met een houten beschoeiing aan beide zijden was het kanaal voorzien
nl|van jaagpaden van meter breed de uit het kanaal vrij gekomen grond was aan de
nl|oever verwerkt met als gevolg dat vrijwel het gehele kanaal zowel het hoofdkanaal als het
nl|kanaal naar de mark was gelegen binnen kanaaldijken op maart inspecteerde de top van rijks
nl|en provinciale waterstaat per schip het traject vanaf de zuid willemsvaart tot tilburg alle ingenieurs
nl|die betrokken waren bij de aanleg waren daarbij aanwezig enkele dagen later op woensdag april
nl|om acht uur in de ochtend werd het kanaal over de gehele lengte voor de
nl|scheepvaart opengesteld in tegenstelling tot de gedeeltelijke openstelling in was deze algehele openstelling geen offici
nl|le gebeurtenis een aankondiging door de minister van waterstaat op pagina van de nederlandsche staatscourant
nl|volstond de totale aanleg had miljoen gulden gekost terwijl bij de indiening van de wet
nl|op juni een bedrag van miljoen gulden was geraamd de kredietcrisis of bankencrisis is de
nl|aanduiding voor de crisis op de financi le markten die in de zomer van ontstond
nl|in het najaar van een hoogtepunt bereikte en pas in de loop van afliep de
nl|crisis ontstond voornamelijk door problemen op de huizenmarkt in de verenigde staten die had in
nl|de voorafgaande jaren een sterke groei laten zien met een sterke stijging van de huizenprijzen
nl|dit was onder meer het gevolg van innovaties op de financi le markten hypotheken werden
nl|traditioneel verstrekt door banken die dit financierden met spaargeld dat door spaarders aan hen werd
nl|toevertrouwd de innovaties bestonden hieruit dat de door banken aan huiseigenaren verstrekte hypothecaire leningen door
nl|die banken werden gebundeld tot pakketten die doorverkocht werden aan daarvoor opgerichte rechtspersonen die rechtspersonen
nl|betaalden die overgenomen leningen door het uitgeven van obligaties die obligaties werden verdeeld in meerdere
nl|risicoklassen afhankelijk van de vraag welke soort obligaties tranches bij betalingsproblemen het eerst zouden moeten
nl|inleveren dit had gevolgen voor de rating kredietwaardigheidsbeoordeling van die tranches toen de huizenmarkt stagneerde
nl|zie hieronder voor een opsomming van de oorzaken daalde het vertrouwen van beleggers in de
nl|kwaliteit van de minst kredietwaardige obligaties subprime en daarna ook in die van de meer
nl|kredietwaardige obligaties dit leidde tot een daling van het vertrouwen in de bancaire sector en
nl|daarna van het vertrouwen in het gehele financi le systeem er moest uiteindelijk voor honderden
nl|miljarden worden afgeschreven op dergelijke obligaties doordat onduidelijk was welke instellingen hierdoor in de problemen

nl|zijn genationaliseerd failliet gegaan of overgenomen negatieve ontwikkelingen op verschillende deelmarkten hebben elkaar versterkt de
nl|ontwikkelingen bedreigden al snel het ongestoord functioneren van het internationale financi le systeem en ingrijpen

nl|is niet exact aan te geven welke gebeurtenissen elkaar op welke wijze be nvloedden in
nl|het algemeen kan gesteld worden dat problemen rond amerikaanse hypotheken de onmiddellijke aanleiding vormden tot
nl|de crisis die oversloeg op de markt voor daaraan gerelateerde complexe financi le producten een
nl|en ander werd versterkt doordat de bij de waardebepaling van dergelijke complexe financi le producten
nl|gebruikte aannames in wiskundige formules zie david x li op drijfzand waren gebaseerd de achterliggende
nl|oorzaken van de crisis zijn zo complex dat het nagenoeg onmogelijk is om een helder
nl|volledig beeld van de situatie te krijgen analyses van de problemen en de fundamentele oplossingen
nl|zijn vaak gericht op slechts een beperkt onderdeel van de crisis de aanduiding kredietcrisis dekt
nl|niet de gehele lading van de crisis er was niet uitsluitend sprake van een kredietcrisis
nl|in de zin van een beperkte beschikbaarheid van liquiditeiten en langer lopend kapitaal doch op
nl|een aantal momenten ook van een algehele onderlinge vertrouwenscrisis in de financi le sector vanaf
nl|begin veranderde de crisis van voorwerp men maakte zich steeds meer zorgen over de financi
nl|le positie van een aantal overheden dit leidde in april tot een crisis rond griekse
nl|overheidsfinanci n ook andere landen met name portugal spanje itali en ierland dreigden in een
nl|financi le crisis te komen de eu ministers van financi n presenteerden op mei een
nl|reddingsplan van in totaal miljard terwijl het imf tot miljard toezegde vanaf had de amerikaanse
nl|woningmarkt een sterke opleving laten zien waarvoor diverse oorzaken zijn aan te wijzen na de
nl|aanslagen van september dreigde aanvankelijk een recessie wat voor de federal reserve het amerikaanse stelsel
nl|van centrale banken aanleiding vormde om de offici le rente in een aantal stappen sterk
nl|te verlagen tot een historisch laag niveau van hierdoor werden leningen waaronder hypotheken duidelijk goedkoper
nl|dit gold met name voor hypotheken met een variabele rente een tweede factor werd gevormd
nl|door een toename van de hoeveelheid liquiditeit in het financi le systeem enerzijds veroorzaakt door
nl|injecties door centrale banken en anderzijds door een toevloed van voor belegging beschikbaar kapitaal met
nl|name vanuit azi een derde factor werd gevormd door de ontwikkeling van een groot aantal
nl|nieuwe hypotheekvormen in de vs dit had betrekking op de volgende aspecten verder werd aanmerkelijk
nl|meer dan voorheen gekozen voor een hypotheek met variabele rente adjustable rate mortgage of arm
nl|in de vs houdt dit in dat de rente gedurende een klein aantal jaren na
nl|de aanvang vaststaat en daarna variabel wordt vaak is de rente vast voor een periode
nl|van twee jaar of vijf jaar de meest ingrijpende verandering had echter betrekking op de
nl|kredietwaardigheid van de hypotheekaanvrager in de verenigde staten wordt hierbij veel waarde gehecht aan de
nl|credit score van de aanvrager een cijfer dat is gebaseerd op zijn betalingsgedrag in het
nl|verleden debiteuren met een slechtere krediethistorie worden hierbij aangeduid als subprime minder dan eerste klas
nl|vanaf circa werden ook aan deze categorie huiseigenaren hypotheken verstrekt het gevolg van deze ontwikkelingen
nl|was een gestage stijging van de huizenprijzen dit leidde tot een grotere belangstelling hetgeen wederom
nl|tot een prijsstijging leidde het eigen huis werd niet langer gezien als onderkomen doch als
nl|speculatieobject het oogmerk van steeds grotere groepen huizenkopers was een huis te kopen teneinde dit
nl|na vrij korte tijd met winst door te verkopen door de tamelijk lage instaprente kon
nl|men aanmerkelijke bedragen lenen doch het huis diende dan wel verkocht te worden voordat de
nl|normale rente in zou gaan men had dus groot belang bij een tijdige verkoop dit
nl|proces van herhaalde aankopen en verkopen stond bekend als flipping in the years leading up
nl|to the crisis a combination of factors including low interest rates lax lending standards a
nl|proliferation of exotic mortgage products and the growth of a global market for securitized loans
nl|fueled a rapid increase in household borrowing an influx of new and often speculative homebuyers
nl|with access to easy credit helped bid up u s house prices to unprecedented levels
nl|relative to rents or disposable income een vierde factor werd gevormd door deregulatie afschaffen van
nl|regelgeving en een falend toezicht op het hanteren van de nog wel geldende regelgeving de
nl|amerikaanse minister van financi n timothy geithner verklaarde tegenover het huis van afgevaardigden op maart
nl|dat tekortschietende regelgeving en gebrekkig toezicht een belangrijke rol gespeeld hadden bij het ontstaan van
nl|de crisis for many years the housing finance system provided credit to households in a
nl|reliable and stable manner setting appropriate standards for mortgage origination and attracting diverse sources of
nl|capital through securitization however insufficient regulation and enforcement was unable to check increasingly lax underwriting
nl|irresponsible lending and excessive risk taking increasing usage of complex products led to a growing
nl|misalignment of incentives facing mortgage brokers originators credit investors and borrowers this fueled unsustainable debt
nl|levels and house price appreciation the risk of a fall in home prices was ignored
nl|by most and there was too much leverage in every part of the system these
nl|problems were worst in the least regulated non bank sectors that fed private label securitizations
nl|over time problems associated with the absence of prudent underwriting standards and effective consumer protection
nl|migrated from these sectors to the more highly regulated channels of mortgage origination including the
nl|banking sector het imf beschreef de situatie overigens jaren later te weten in zijn global
nl|financial stability report van april als een periode van vrijwel onbeperkte beschikbaarheid van goedkoop krediet
nl|a period of almost indiscriminate availability of cheap credit achteraf bleek dat in een niet
nl|gering aantal gevallen leningen waren verstrekt die achteraf gezien slechts zowel vanuit het oogpunt van
nl|de huiseigenaar als vanuit dat van de financier bezien als uitermate roekeloos te kwalificeren waren
nl|onder meer bleek dat er op grote schaal was uitgegaan van onjuiste gegevens omtrent de
nl|financi le positie van de aanvrager deels kwam dit doordat er stated income hypotheken verstrekt
nl|werden waarbij de aanvrager zonder enig bewijs te hoeven overleggen zijn inkomen kon opgeven anderzijds
nl|waren ook hypotheekadviseurs en tussenpersonen verantwoordelijk voor het verschaffen van onjuiste informatie om een grotere
nl|hypotheekproductie en dus premies te kunnen realiseren opgemerkt moet worden dat het risico voor de
nl|huizenbezitters kleiner is dan dat in europa zou zijn in een aantal staten in de
nl|v s kan men de sleutel inleveren bij de bank als de hypotheekschuld hoger is
nl|dan de waarde van het huis de restschuld wordt niet verhaald op de voormalige huiseigenaar
nl|zolang de huizenprijzen bleven stijgen ging echter alles goed door de gestegen huizenprijzen kon men
nl|zijn huis met winst verkopen en een groter huis kopen of kon men op basis
nl|van dat extra onderpand geld lenen en de vrijgekomen middelen aanwenden voor consumptieve bestedingen beide
nl|activiteiten vormden in die jaren een duidelijke positieve conjuncturele impuls ook werden huizen gekocht voor
nl|uitsluitend speculatieve doeleinden voor veel amerikanen was speculatie met het eigen huis tevens de enige
nl|kans om financi le zekerheid te verwerven gegeven de voorgaande twee decennia van loonstagnatie en
nl|bezuinigingen op de sociale zekerheid door een aantal oorzaken stagneerde dit proces vanaf medio c
nl|een van de oorzaken was een serie renteverhogingen door de federal reserve hetgeen een stijging
nl|van de hypotheekrente met zich meebracht een tweede factor was dat de woningprijzen een zodanig
nl|niveau bereikten dat ze voor steeds grotere groepen huizenkopers onbetaalbaar werden vanaf medio namen betalingsachterstanden
nl|duidelijk toe met name bij de subprime hypotheken tevens bereikte een toenemend aantal leningen het
nl|einde van hun rentevaste periode en werden de huiseigenaren geconfronteerd met een aanmerkelijk hogere rente
nl|in het typische geval met circa tot procentpunt hun lasten namen daarmee sterk toe bij
nl|leningen met een lage instaprente kon deze stijging nog aanmerkelijk groter zijn bij de negative
nl|amortization loan kon tevens de mogelijkheid tot negatieve aflossing vervallen in sommige situaties kon hierdoor
nl|sprake zijn van een verveelvoudiging van de maandelijkse lasten door deze oorzaken daalde de belangstelling
nl|voor steeds grotere en of duurdere huizen hetgeen onder meer tot uitdrukking kwam in een
nl|afname van het aantal nieuwgebouwde woningen en in een afname van het aantal verkopen van
nl|bestaande woningen het aantal gedwongen verkopen foreclosures nam sterk toe dit proces ging nog geruime
nl|tijd door over het derde kwartaal van bleek het aantal foreclosure notices te zijn gestegen
nl|tot ruim wat meer was dan in het derde kwartaal van in maart bleek dat
nl|er sinds meer dan miljoen foreclosures hadden plaatsgevonden vanaf eind moest een toenemend aantal meestal
nl|kleinere doch ook een aantal grotere hypotheekbanken zijn activiteiten inkrimpen of soms geheel staken vanaf
nl|begin verscherpten hypotheekbanken hun leningsvoorwaarden hetgeen tot gevolg had dat het verkrijgen van nieuwe zowel
nl|als vervangende hypotheken steeds moeilijker en duurder werd de getroffen huiseigenaren waren in sommige gevallen
nl|genoodzaakt onderdak te zoeken in ge mproviseerde tentenkampen de hierboven beschreven ontwikkelingen deden zich ook
nl|in soms mindere mate voor op woning en hypotheekmarkten elders met name in het verenigd
nl|koninkrijk waren huizenprijzen ook sterk gestegen doch vanaf circa maart trad een daling op hetgeen
nl|leidde tot een toename van het aantal te koop staande woningen ook hier speelde een
nl|rol dat in dit geval britse hypotheekverstrekkers niet alleen hun rentetarieven verhoogden maar ook hun
nl|leningsvoorwaarden aanscherpten tevens speelde in het verenigd koninkrijk het verschijnsel buy to let een rol
nl|het door particulieren kopen van een woning met het doel deze vaak na een renovatie
nl|met winst te verhuren bij een dergelijke investering speelt de verhouding tussen de te betalen
nl|hypotheekrente en de te ontvangen huur minus de kosten van onderhoud en eventueel renovatie een
nl|grote rol indien dergelijke beleggingen niet meer aantrekkelijk gevonden worden leidt dat tot een sterke
nl|daling van de vraag naar daarvoor in aanmerking komende woningen ook is hierbij van belang
nl|dat het grootste deel van britse hypotheken een rente heeft die gekoppeld is aan de
nl|geldmarktrente zodat rentewijzigingen door de bank of england de britse centrale bank direct doorwerken in
nl|de hoogte van de hypotheekrente in canada waarvan de economie in hoge mate afhankelijk is
nl|van de export naar de verenigde staten kwam de stijging van de huizenprijzen vanaf het
nl|begin van tot stilstand ook in ierland was sprake van een daling van de huizenprijzen
nl|hierbij speelt een rol dat ierland sedert het midden van de jaren van de twintigste
nl|eeuw een sterke economische groei had vertoond met name in en rond dublin hadden zich
nl|vele buitenlandse bedrijven gevestigd mede onder invloed van fiscale faciliteiten dit had geleid tot een
nl|sterke vraag naar woningen in die regio wat de huizenprijzen sterk had opgedreven in nederland
nl|was tot circa medio sprake van een gestage stijging van de huizenprijzen die in het
nl|vierde kwartaal van enigszins afvlakte vanaf het derde kwartaal van begonnen de huizenprijzen te dalen
nl|in het eerste kwartaal van zette de daling zich voort om in de volgende kwartalen
nl|op een veel lager volume bijna te stabiliseren niet alleen het uitstaande bedrag aan woninghypotheken
nl|in de vs en elders was toegenomen ook andere typen leningen lieten in de loop
nl|der jaren een sterke toename zien dit gold ook voor leningen aan commerci le ondernemingen
nl|vaak in het kader van leveraged buy outs voor leningen aan financi le instellingen en
nl|voor staatsleningen en andere leningen aan lagere overheden deze toename dient uiteraard gecorrigeerd te worden
nl|voor de inflatie die in de loop der jaren is opgetreden maar ook na deze
nl|correctie is sprake van een duidelijke toename van de verhouding van de totale schuld versus
nl|het nationale inkomen dit verschijnsel deed zich in de gehele ge ndustrialiseerde wereld voor het
nl|gevolg was dat de financi le sector een steeds groter aandeel in de totale economie
nl|kreeg in een extreme vorm bleek dit in ijsland het geval te zijn het gevolg
nl|was dat steeds meer partijen in de economie relatief steeds grotere bedragen leenden en uitleenden
nl|en dat er over de breedte van de economie gezien steeds meer sprake was van
nl|leverage het verschijnsel dat er gegeven een bepaald eigen vermogen sprake is van steeds grotere
nl|bedragen aan geleend geld enerzijds en vorderingen uitgeleend geld en overige bezittingen anderzijds de netto
nl|financi le positie werd daarmee steeds meer gevoelig voor mogelijk niet parallelle veranderingen in de
nl|componenten van die balans de totale schulden van de diverse sectoren in de vs ontwikkelden
nl|zich sinds als hiernaast aangegeven voor andere landen en regio s zijn geen vergelijkbare cijfers
nl|voorhanden maar op basis van een vergelijking van cijfers van deelgebieden kan worden aangenomen dat
nl|dit verschijnsel zich ook elders mogelijk in mindere mate heeft voorgedaan vanaf ongeveer het einde
nl|van bleek echter sprake te zijn van een omslag in dit proces het totaal aan
nl|uitstaande leningen nam minder toe en soms zelfs af in hoeverre dit een kwestie is
nl|van afgenomen bereidheid van financiers om leningen te verstrekken of van mindere geneigdheid van debiteuren
nl|om leningen op te nemen is voor discussie vatbaar de in die periode toenemende spaarquote
nl|in de vs doet vermoeden dat beide factoren een rol speelden het gevolg van dit
nl|proces was dat de reeds ingezette contractie van de economie in ieder geval niet verminderd
nl|werd however far more serious than this decline in growth we have the durably lower
nl|level of expenditure related to credit purchases of real estate durable goods cars etc this
nl|contraction in demand is a far more serious development than the decline in the long
nl|run growth in demand and one fails to see how economic policies could prevent it
nl|sedert het begin van de kredietcrisis is in de vs een stabilisatie van het bedrag
nl|aan uitstaand hypothecair krediet te zien gevolgd door een zekere daling ook de ontwikkeling van
nl|het totale bedrag aan consumptief krediet met name auto loans en credit cards liet na
nl|een jarenlange gestage stijging vanaf eind een stabilisatie zien later gevolgd door een duidelijke daling
nl|een afname van het bedrag aan opgenomen geld wordt aangeduid als deleveraging waarbij de oorzaak
nl|zowel kan zijn gelegen in een mindere beschikbaarheid van krediet als in een afname van
nl|de vraag naar krediet het effect op de re le economie kan echter zeer negatief
nl|zijn de macro economische effecten waren voor de amerikaanse overheid reden om een grootschalig stimuleringsprogramma
nl|op te zetten men kondigde op november aan voornemens te zijn de nog resterende miljard
nl|van het reddingsplan van miljard waartoe begin oktober werd besloten te willen gebruiken voor het
nl|vlot trekken van de markt voor consumentenleningen autoleningen en studieleningen later werd dit plan echter
nl|weer verlaten op december berichtte de federal reserve voornemens te zijn om voor miljard aan
nl|laagrentende leningen te verstrekken aan beleggingsinstellingen waaronder begrepen hedgefondsen op voorwaarde dat die hiervoor gesecuritiseerde
nl|consumer loans zouden kopen op februari werd de verdere uitwerking van dit plan aangeduid als
nl|term asset backed securities loan facility bekendgemaakt omvang werkingssfeer en looptijd werden later uitgebreid ook
nl|in de eurozone namen de schulden van zowel de overheid als de private sector in
nl|de loop der jaren sterk toe sedert het begin van de datum van invoering van
nl|de girale euro ontwikkelden ze zich als volgens nevenstaande grafiek de hypothecaire leningen werden door
nl|hypotheekbanken niet zelf gefinancierd maar werden relatief snel door de hypotheekbanken aan derden doorverkocht dit
nl|proces staat bekend als securitization en de daaruit resulterende obligaties als mortgage backed securities mbs
nl|een verdere innovatie vond plaats door middel van collateralized debt obligations cdo s waarbij binnen
nl|een pakket obligaties een onderlinge rangorde werd aangebracht ten aanzien van de volgorde waarin betaling
nl|van rente en aflossing zou worden ontvangen mede doordat deze producten gecombineerd werden met derivaten
nl|werd het moeilijk om in te schatten wat de waarde hiervan was de complexiteit van
nl|dergelijke producten kan met de volgende anekdote ge llustreerd worden in november publiceerde dan edstrom
nl|een amerikaanse deskundige op het gebied van de administratieve organisatie van securitisatieprogramma s zijn bevindingen
nl|van een onderzoek wie nu eigenlijk de houder van zijn eigen hypotheek was dit onderzoek
nl|had een jaar in beslag genomen er bleken in diverse hoedanigheden een groot aantal rechtspersonen
nl|bij betrokken te zijn geweest de schematische weergave besloeg een dichtbedrukte pagina topbelegger warren buffett
nl|waarschuwde specifiek tegen de enorme proliferatie van deze producten hij noemt ze bij onoordeelkundig gebruik
nl|financi le massavernietigingswapens bij iedere vorm van beleggen wordt regelmatig de waarde van de investeringen
nl|vastgesteld meestal kan hierbij gebruik worden gemaakt van een beurskoers bij de hier genoemde cdo
nl|s was vaak geen beursnotering aanwezig zonder beurskoers dient de waarde geschat te worden door
nl|gebruik te maken van de koers van vergelijkbare staatsleningen gecorrigeerd voor enerzijds het algemene verschil
nl|in kredietwaardigheid de credit spread en anderzijds de vermoedelijke kans op wanbetaling default voor het
nl|schatten van de kans op wanbetaling werden statistische technieken losgelaten op historische gegevens omtrent het
nl|betalingsgedrag van huiseigenaren deze techniek waarbij een belegging werd gewaardeerd aan de hand van een
nl|rekenmodel noemt men marking to model waardering op basis van beurskoersen noemt men marking to
nl|market het gevaar van waardebepaling op basis van een model is dat het kwetsbaar is
nl|voor fouten en manipulatie en het bovendien schijnzekerheid biedt het nadeel van marking to market
nl|is echter dat als de markt in een bepaald type activa tot stilstand is gekomen
nl|er op die markt niet of nauwelijks transacties tot stand komen er geen goed aanknopingspunt
nl|voor de waardebepaling van activa voorhanden is de amerikaanse federal accounting standards board stelde in
nl|maart voor om het mark to market principe niet meer onverkort toe te passen d
nl|het probleem van moeilijk te waarderen activa bleef met grote regelmaat de gemoederen bezighouden enerzijds
nl|werd erop gewezen dat als er geen noodzaak of voornemen is om een bepaalde bezitting
nl|te verkopen het niet nodig zou moeten zijn een mogelijk tijdelijke waardedaling direct in de
nl|gerapporteerde balans zichtbaar te maken als voorbeeld werd hierbij gewezen op de hypothecaire lening die
nl|reeds geruime tijd zonder problemen wordt afbetaald en derhalve tegen ongeveer de nominale waarde zou
nl|moeten kunnen worden opgenomen doch die in een distressed market tegen een aanmerkelijk lagere koers
nl|zou moeten worden gewaardeerd slechts indien verkoop beoogd werd zou de lagere marktwaarde moeten gelden
nl|hiertoe werd een onderscheid in de beleggingsportefeuille voorgesteld tussen hold to maturity en available for
nl|sale anderzijds werd er op gewezen dat een dergelijke methode ertoe zou leiden dat banken
nl|hun activa zo veel mogelijk in die eerste categorie zouden houden en dat het voor
nl|vermogensverschaffers niet meer mogelijk zou zijn om zich een beeld te vormen van wat de
nl|activa in het geval van liquidatie waard zouden zijn het zicht op de werkelijke waarde
nl|van een bank zou daarmee versluierd worden in de daaropvolgende weken nam de twijfel omtrent
nl|de correcte waardering van dergelijke beleggingen toe de betalingsachterstanden namen dusdanige vormen aan dat de
nl|op het verleden gebaseerde modellen niet langer bruikbaar werden geacht tevens bleek dat steeds minder
nl|partijen bereid waren om een markt te onderhouden in de betreffende obligaties dit betekende dat
nl|noch marking to model noch marking to market tot een correcte waardebepaling zou kunnen leiden
nl|in juli meldde een dochter van de franse bank bnp paribas dat zij van drie
nl|door haar beheerde beleggingsfondsen niet in staat was de waarde vast te stellen aangezien the
nl|complete absence of liquidity in certain market segments of the u s securitization market has
nl|made it impossible to value certain assets fairly regardless of their quality or credit rating
nl|vergelijkbare berichten of vermoedens waren reeds eerder van of omtrent andere partijen vernomen daarnaast rezen
nl|er twijfels over de credit ratings zoals die zijn afgegeven door standard poor s en
nl|moody s in de daaropvolgende dagen en weken nam de onzekerheid in de markt toe
nl|en werden steeds meer twijfels geuit omtrent de waarderingsmodellen van derivaten in het algemeen een
nl|groot deel van de op de financi le markten verhandelde derivaten wordt niet op een
nl|beurs verhandeld maar onderling in the over the counter markt dus over de toonbank de
nl|twijfel omtrent de waardering van beleggingen werd in de loop van de crisis niet weggenomen
nl|vanaf circa medio werden steeds meer vraagtekens geplaatst bij de waardering van ook normale financi
nl|le producten waarbij hypotheken betrokken waren vanwege de gebrekkige liquiditeit van dergelijke leningen dit probleem
nl|bleef regelmatig de kop opsteken de autoriteit financi le markten uitte in een begin december
nl|verschenen rapport kritiek op een aantal accountantskantoren die bij de beoordeling van de waardering van
nl|complexe financi le producten door market to model onvoldoende de merites en werking van die
nl|modellen hadden onderzocht bij n of meer kantoren kondigde de afm een normoverdragend gesprek aan
nl|in juni meldde de amerikaanse bank bear stearns dat twee door haar beheerde hedgefondsen e
nl|in de problemen waren geraakt de beide hedgefondsen belegden onder andere in cdo s en
nl|waardeerden hun beleggingen marking to model te hoog in vergelijking met de waardering in de
nl|markt marking to market de verliezen door de afboekingen waren dusdanig dat bear stearns zich
nl|gedwongen zag in te grijpen dat het hier hedgefondsen betrof heeft op zich weinig met
nl|de kredietcrisis te maken de problemen vloeiden voort uit de aard van de beleggingen het
nl|is echter wel zo dat mezzanine cdo s en in sterkere mate equity tranche cdo
nl|s door hun risicoprofiel in meer dan gemiddelde mate voor hedgefondsen interessant waren in de
nl|periode voordat de kredietcrisis losbarstte was er discussie in de media over de rol van
nl|hedgefondsen tijdens de kredietcrisis bleek de rol van hedgefunds vrij klein te zijn door toegenomen
nl|onzekerheid over de wijze van functioneren van de financi le markten trokken beleggers hun tegoeden
nl|terug uit fondsen aangezien hedgefondsen en beleggingsfondsen hun beleggers moeten uitkeren indien de beleggers hun
nl|inleg terugvragen f moest dan een gedeelte van de portefeuille verkocht worden het in feite
nl|gedwongen verkopen van grote posities versterkte de koersbewegingen op de beurzen de twee beheerders van
nl|de hierboven genoemde fondsen van bear stearns ralph cioffi en matthew tannin werden vervolgd ter
nl|zake van beweerde misleiding van beleggers doch op november door een jury vrijgesproken een belangrijke
nl|rol in het mondiale financi le systeem wordt gevormd door de interbancaire geldmarkt de markt
nl|waarbij vooral banken elkaar voor korte perioden vari rend van n dag tot twee jaar
nl|vaak omvangrijke leningen verstrekken met behulp van deze leningen kunnen banken in hun behoefte aan
nl|liquide middelen voorzien en kunnen zij overtollige liquiditeiten voor korte perioden rentedragend beleggen voor een
nl|soepel functioneren van deze markt is het vertrouwen in een correct nakomen van de verplichtingen
nl|uiteraard essentieel centrale banken opereren tevens op deze markt in het kader van hun monetaire
nl|beleid waarbij door het verstrekken van liquiditeiten of door het geforceerd afromen van liquiditeiten de
nl|geldhoeveelheid en de rente op de geldmarkt gestuurd kan worden de vraag of dit sturingsinstrument
nl|steeds correct werkt wordt hier verder buiten beschouwing gelaten evenals de vraag of dit tot
nl|ongewenste neveneffecten leidt in dit verband wordt wel opgemerkt dat een beleid waarbij centrale banken
nl|naar verwacht wordt steeds in problemen verkerende financi le instellingen te hulp zullen komen kan
nl|leiden tot roekeloos gedrag in geval van problemen zal men wel geholpen worden dit staat
nl|bekend als moral hazard op augustus bleek dat er zich binnen het europese bankwezen kennelijk
nl|een crisis dreigde voor te doen de geldmarkttarieven stegen plotseling scherp de ecb kondigde een
nl|eendaagse liquiditeitssteun aan waarbij europese banken tegen onbeperkt geld konden lenen doch wel tegen een
nl|toereikend onderpand hierop werd voor miljard toegewezen niet bekend is of er banken in een
nl|liquiditeitscrisis verkeerden en zo ja welke banken dat waren toezichthouders plegen hierover geen mededelingen te
nl|doen in de daaropvolgende dagen werd nogmaals een dergelijke extra faciliteit gebruikt doch voor lagere
nl|bedragen op augustus miljard en op augustus miljard deze faciliteiten vervingen steeds de eerdere faciliteit
nl|de bedragen kunnen niet bij elkaar opgeteld worden andere centrale banken verstrekten ook dergelijke kortlopende
nl|faciliteiten doch voor kleinere bedragen op de amerikaanse geld en kapitaalmarkt deed zich eveneens een
nl|credit crunch voor beleggers bleken niet langer bereid om onbeperkt leningen van hypotheekbanken over te
nl|nemen zodat het hierboven beschreven proces van securitization stokte hypotheekbanken bleken verder geconfronteerd te worden
nl|met de noodzaak bij gedwongen verkopen huizen zelf in te kopen aangezien er geen voldoende
nl|belangstelling voor bestond deze hypotheekbanken waren echter grotendeels met kortlopende leningen gefinancierd de gesignaleerde problemen
nl|waren echter voor de verstrekkers van die leningen reden zeer terughoudend te zijn met voortgezette
nl|verstrekking daarvan het gevolg was een snel toenemend financieringsprobleem bij een toenemend aantal hypotheekbanken een
nl|aantal hypotheekbanken vroeg surseance aan andere banken dienden terug te vallen op leningsarrangementen bij hun
nl|huisbankiers tegen onbekende doch vermoedelijk hoge rentes op augustus verlaagde de federal reserve zijn discount
nl|rate het toptarief waartegen banken van de amerikaanse centrale bank kunnen lenen van tot naast
nl|het opdrogen van de interbancaire geld en depositohandel was ook sprake van een toegenomen argwaan
nl|van ondernemingen om hun tegoeden bij verdachte banken te plaatsen men gaf de voorkeur aan
nl|een bank met een hogere rating dan hun huisbank in de kredietcrisis heeft de bonuscultuur
nl|bij grote banken een niet onbelangrijke rol gespeeld topbestuurders en succesvolle handelaren ontvingen in de
nl|jaren voorafgaande aan de kredietcrisis zeer grote bonussen dit leidde naarmate de kredietcrisis voortschreed tot
nl|kritiek naarmate de kredietcrisis verder voortschreed ontstond in de samenleving steeds meer ongenoegen omtrent de
nl|vermeende g rol die het bankwezen had gespeeld bij het ontstaan van de crisis op
nl|diverse momenten werd dit ongenoegen geuit onder meer door het beschadigen van de woning van
nl|de voormalige bestuursvoorzitter van rbs sir fred goodwin en bij demonstraties op april in de
nl|londense city de toegenomen onmin in de samenleving omtrent het functioneren van het bankwezen leidde
nl|er tevens toe dat de nederlandse bankensector in juni aankondigde een gedragscode te zullen opstellen
nl|in samenwerking met het ministerie van financi n de code zou in een wet worden
nl|vastgelegd uitspraken van lloyd blankfein ceo van goldman sachs dat bankiers gods werk deden leidden
nl|mede in de context van de beweerde grote invloed van goldman sachs op het handelen
nl|van de amerikaanse overheid in november tot kritische reacties in het najaar van ontstond een
nl|nieuwe golf van uitingen van ongenoegen mede ingegeven door de mate waarin de bankencrisis was
nl|overgegaan in een algehele schuldencrisis men ging locaties bezetten die met het kapitalisme werden geassocieerd
nl|de beweging die deze uitingen organiseerde werd bekend als occupy waarbij meestal de naam van
nl|de betreffende locatie werd genoemd de geuite wensen waren divers van aard doch hadden meestal
nl|als gemeenschappelijk element dat de banken in sterkere mate verantwoordelijk dienden te worden gesteld voor
nl|de ontstane schade in plaats van deze op de samenleving af te wentelen en zelf
nl|buiten schot te blijven na medio augustus moest een groot aantal banken en andere financi
nl|le instellingen afwaarderingen op beleggingen rapporteren in diverse gevallen bleken reddingsoperaties noodzakelijk in een aantal
nl|gevallen werden nieuwe aandelen geplaatst bij sovereign wealth funds in azi of het midden oosten

nl|begin november werd in steeds meer statistische cijfers zichtbaar dat de re le economie in
nl|een hoog tempo afkoelde om te voorkomen dat dit tot een recessie zou leiden of

nl|volgens de meest gehanteerde definitie sprake was van een recessie op november bleek dit ook

nl|s aangekondigd waarmee beoogd werd de recessie in te dammen in duitsland voor miljard en
nl|in het verenigd koninkrijk voor gbp miljard een in dit kader optredende overschrijding van de

nl|de crisis zwaar getroffen spanje kondigde premier zapatero pas in januari het zogenaamde plan e
nl|af dat een totale investering van miljard voorzag ter stimulering van de economie op december
nl|voerden diverse centrale banken relatief omvangrijke verlagingen van de offici le rentetarieven door op diezelfde
nl|dag bleek dat de eurozone eveneens in een recessie verkeerde een week later bleek dit
nl|ook in japan het geval te zijn eind januari bleek dat ook de verenigde staten
nl|volgens de offici le cijfers in een recessie verkeerde na een krimp van en in
nl|respectievelijk het derde en vierde kwartaal van eind februari werd het cijfer omtrent het vierde
nl|kwartaal herzien tot omgerekend over een geheel jaar hetgeen de sterkste krimp sedert was als
nl|gevolg van de opkomende recessie werd het gestaag moeilijker de effecten van de kredietcrisis nog
nl|te onderscheiden wel was duidelijk dat de kredietverlenende functie van het bankwezen niet optimaal functioneerde
nl|als gevolg van verslechterde balansverhoudingen was het voor het bankwezen moeilijker en duurder om vermogen
nl|aan te trekken zowel in de vorm van aandelenkapitaal als in de vorm van vreemd
nl|vermogen de noodzaak de vermogensverhoudingen te versterken of in ieder geval niet verder te laten
nl|verslechteren bracht met zich mee dat banken meer terughoudendheid betrachtten bij het verstrekken van nieuwe
nl|leningen in februari werd bekend dat de japanse economie in het vierde kwartaal van met
nl|was gedaald wat de grootste daling sinds was vanaf februari ontstond toenemende zorg omtrent de
nl|gevolgen die de kredietcrisis zou hebben voor de financi le positie van overheden enerzijds leidde
nl|de toenemende recessie tot lagere belastingopbrengsten terwijl de steunmaatregelen voor extra uitgaven zorgden hetgeen in
nl|een aantal gevallen nog aanmerkelijk versterkt zou kunnen worden indien door overheden afgegeven garanties tot
nl|uitbetaling zouden komen in dit verband werden met name ierland en oostenrijk genoemd de eerste
nl|vanwege de grote omvang van de ten behoeve van ierse banken afgegeven garanties de tweede
nl|vanwege de grote omvang van door oostenrijkse banken verstrekte leningen aan debiteuren in landen in

nl|in de eurozone recordniveaus in het laatste kwartaal van en het eerste kwartaal van kromp
nl|de economie van australi de zweedse riksbank verlaagde haar rente naar op april andere grootschalige
nl|vormen van overheidsingrijpen zijn tevens hieronder vermeld teneinde doublures te beperken vanaf circa maart werd
nl|duidelijk dat landen wier economie sterk van export afhankelijk was zeer zwaar door de crisis
nl|waren geraakt zo liep de export van maleisi in januari met op jaarbasis terug en
nl|de export van japan met de economie van singapore kromp in het eerste kwartaal van
nl|met in mei bleek dat de economie in duitsland en nederland de grootste krimp in

nl|van kwamen steeds meer ondernemingen in moeilijkheden tot de meest bekende behoorden autofabrikanten chrysler en
nl|general motors die in mei respectievelijk juni uitstel van betaling verkregen in augustus bleek dat
nl|frankrijk duitsland en japan over het tweede kwartaal van een positieve groei hadden gezien waarmee
nl|de recessie in die landen formeel voorbij was volgens een rapport van de oeso gepubliceerd
nl|op september zou de recessie mondiaal gezien reeds ongeveer voorbij kunnen zijn op oktober werd
nl|bekend dat de amerikaanse economie in het derde kwartaal was gegroeid met annualized zijnde een
nl|groei in dat kwartaal van bijna maal vier na vier achtereenvolgende kwartalen krimp hiermee was
nl|de recessie in de vs volgens de meest gehanteerde definitie ten einde op november bleek
nl|dat de nederlandse economie in het derde kwartaal van aan de beterende hand was waarmee
nl|de recessie formeel gesproken ten einde was ook de economie van de gehele eurozone was
nl|in het derde kwartaal gegroeid de financi le positie van amerikaanse staten werd door lagere

nl|en dergelijke de recessie die zich verhevigde als gevolg van de kredietcrisis had ook grote
nl|gevolgen voor met name de amerikaanse auto industrie de effecten van de kredietcrisis op de
nl|conjunctuur in het algemeen zijn ook achteraf moeilijk cijfermatig aan te geven in het algemeen
nl|kan gesteld worden dat een kleiner vermogen woningen aandelen enzovoort na verloop van tijd een
nl|remmend effect op de economische groei heeft mede veroorzaakt door een afnemend consumentenvertrouwen een daling
nl|van de huizenprijzen in de v s of elders bleek te leiden tot een dalende
nl|werkgelegenheid in sectoren als de bouw bouwmaterialen woninginrichting alsmede gespecialiseerde dienstverlening als makelaardij en bankwezen
nl|dat de huizenboom een positief effect op de conjunctuur had en dat het inzakken ervan
nl|een negatief effect had staat wel vast doch een kwantificering is vrijwel niet te geven
nl|de federal reserve bank of dallas raamde in juli dat de gestegen huizenprijzen punt tot
nl|punt aan de consumptie hadden toegevoegd en per eind tot eenzelfde daling hadden geleid na
nl|het inzakken van de huizenmarkt de verslechterde vermogenspositie van pensioenfondsen had tot gevolg dat aannemelijk
nl|is dat gedane pensioentoezeggingen en ingegane pensioenen niet volledig konden worden ge ndexeerd hetgeen een
nl|negatief effect heeft op de koopkracht van huidige of toekomstige deelnemers nederlandse pensioenfondsen zagen zich
nl|genoodzaakt voor af te zien van indexatie van pensioenrechten en ingegane pensioenen de herstelplannen die
nl|nederlandse pensioenfondsen met een ontoereikende dekkingsgraad in maart indienden voorzagen in een afzien van indexatie
nl|voor meerdere jaren na het dieptepunt van de crisis bleek de kredietverstrekking op een voorlopig
nl|structureel lager niveau te zijn beland het volume aan leningen door amerikaanse banken aan het
nl|midden en kleinbedrijf verstrekt vertoonde vanaf eind een sterke daling om eerst vanaf de zomer
nl|van ongeveer te stabiliseren i de gebrekkige beschikbaarheid van krediet voor kleinere ondernemingen met negatieve
nl|gevolgen voor het herstel van de economische groei werd bijvoorbeeld geconstateerd in de notulen van
nl|de vergadering van het federal open market committe van de federal reserve van en december
nl|de aangescherpte leningscriteria lending standards van amerikaanse hypotheekverstrekkers leidden er ook later toe dat potenti
nl|le huiseigenaren geen her financiering konden krijgen de stimulerende werking van de historisch lage amerikaanse
nl|hypotheekrente werd hiermee verminderd in september bleek dat circa van de aangevraagde hypotheken werd afgewezen
nl|wegens een te lage credit score het proces van gestaag terugdringen van schulden bleek lang
nl|door te gaan in november bleek dat in twee jaar tijd amerikaanse consumenten bijna miljard
nl|aan schulden buiten hypotheken hadden afgelost brancheorganisatie mkb nederland stelde in november dat banken steeds
nl|strengere eisen stelden bij de kredietverlening aan kleinere ondernemingen hoewel de amerikaanse woningmarkt zich vanaf
nl|de zomer van stabiliseerde bleef het aantal foreclosures op een hoog niveau de markt voor
nl|gesecuritiseerde hypotheken lag nog geheel stil zodat het overgrote deel van de nieuw verstrekte hypotheken
nl|afkomstig was van de de facto overheidsinstellingen freddie mac en fannie mae vanaf vond bij
nl|een toenemend aantal pay option arm hypotheken renteherziening plaats waarbij vaak een aanmerkelijke stijging van
nl|de maandlasten zou optreden hierbij speelde een versterkende rol dat bij deze leningen in de
nl|eerste jaren niet de volledige rente werd betaald doch na de herziening dient dat wel
nl|te geschieden j verwacht werd dat de omvang hiervan in en groter zou zijn dan
nl|in vergelijkbare problemen werden verwacht met interest only hypotheken waarbij gedurende de eerste jaren alleen
nl|rente wordt betaald doch waarbij de aflossing vervolgens in een versterkt tempo dient plaats te

nl|problemen te ondervinden door een toenemende leegstand de prijzen van amerikaans commercieel onroerend goed bleken
nl|in december lager te liggen dan ten tijde van het hoogtepunt van oktober in het
nl|vierde kwartaal van bedroeg de leegstand van kleinere amerikaanse winkelcentra strip malls het hoogste cijfers
nl|sinds de leegstand van amerikaanse kantoorpanden steeg in het vierde kwartaal van tot het hoogste
nl|niveau in jaar circa medio ontstond een discussie tussen de beleidsmakers onderling en onder economen
nl|over de merites van verdere bezuinigingen het ene standpunt vooral aangehangen door de amerikaanse regering
nl|en verwoord door onder meer de econoom krugman was dat verder bezuinigen contraproductief zou zijn
nl|aangezien daardoor de groei afgeremd zou worden de voorkeur diende gegeven te worden aan een
nl|voorlopig voortzetten van de diverse stimuleringsmaatregelen de kosten daarvan zouden uit de toekomstige groei gefinancierd
nl|kunnen worden de tegengestelde visie vooral aangehangen door europese regeringen was dat de overheidstekorten en
nl|staatsschulden reeds zo hoog waren opgelopen dat verdere schulden het noodzakelijke gevolg van verdere stimuleringsmaatregelen
nl|zouden leiden tot een neerwaartse spiraal van toenemende rentelasten die de groei juist zouden afremmen
nl|op de vergadering van de g in toronto op en juni werd hierover geen eensluidend
nl|standpunt ingenomen de problemen van het financi le stelsel bleven nog geruime tijd een negatieve
nl|invloed op de economie uitoefenen dit werd onder meer opgemerkt in het global financial stability
nl|report van het imf van oktober waarin het werd omschreven als de achilleshiel van het
nl|economisch herstel de veelheid aan maatregelen waarmee de amerikaanse overheid de woningmarkt ondersteunde zie elders

nl|de s p case shiller index bleek in januari te zijn gedaald tot slechts weinig
nl|boven het dieptepunt na de top van april van de effecten van diverse sedert het
nl|begin van de crisis aangekondigde reddingsplannen bleken tamelijk beperkt te zijn de federal housing finance
nl|agency presenteerde in november een programma voor het modificeren van hypotheken de werkingssfeer werd geschat
nl|op duizenden leners voor het hope for homeowners programma gestart in oktober bleken in december
nl|slechts aanvragen te zijn ingediend in plaats van de beoogde in een aantal gevallen bleek
nl|wel met een huiseigenaar overeenstemming te zijn bereikt over een tijdelijke verlaging van de hypotheeklasten
nl|maar dit impliceerde een uitstel van betaling van een deel van de lasten hetgeen een
nl|verschuiven van die lasten naar de toekomst inhoudt eind maart bleek dat voor dit programma
nl|dat miljard beschikbaar stelde voor herfinanciering van hypotheken aanvragen waren ingediend slechts n vervangende hypotheek
nl|was verstrekt het bleek overigens dat het niet zelden voorkomt dat huiseigenaren nadat hun hypotheek
nl|is aangepast later wederom redefault in betalingsproblemen kwamen te verkeren van de hypotheken die in
nl|het eerste kwartaal van werden gemodificeerd was na zes maanden bij ruim wederom sprake van
nl|betalingsachterstanden de securitisatie van hypotheken heeft tot gevolg dat er een scheiding is tussen de

nl|de administratie deze laatste heeft geen eigen financieel belang bij het tijd en geld kostende
nl|proces van het heronderhandelen van de verplichtingen van bestaande hypotheken ook werden signalen opgevangen dat
nl|de markt voor commercieel onroerend goed vooral kantoorgebouwen en winkelcentra ook de gevolgen van de
nl|crisis ondervond in de vorm van een stroever verlopende financiering en toenemende leegstand voor ratingbureau

nl|vastgoed sterk stegen ondanks alle overheidsmaatregelen bleken de betalingsachterstanden op amerikaanse hypotheken tot begin gestaag
nl|te stijgen zie nevenstaande grafiek in maart kondigde de amerikaanse overheid een programma aan waarbij
nl|miljard ter beschikking werd gesteld voor het herfinancieren van hypotheken ter voorkoming van foreclosures de
nl|randvoorwaarden waren echter zodanig dat commentatoren reeds bij de aankondiging hun twijfels uitspraken over het
nl|effect ervan k het federal housing finance agency berichtte in augustus dat tot en met
nl|juli ruim miljoen hypotheken door freddie mac en fannie mae waren geherfinancierd waarvan circa onder
nl|het making home affordable refinance program in september rapporteerde de beheerder van het home affordable
nl|modification program dat er trial modifications waren waarvan de fase van een aanbod aan de
nl|huiseigenaar hadden bereikt hij verklaarde echter nog miljoenen foreclosures te verwachten medio oktober bleek dat
nl|circa hypotheken een proefperiode van modification hadden gekregen doch dat per september slechts hypotheken definitief
nl|herzien waren in december publiceerde de amerikaanse overheid cijfers omtrent de resultaten tot dan toe
nl|van het home affordable modification program aangeboden voorlopige herzieningen hadden geleid tot definitieve herzieningen terwijl
nl|voorlopige herzieningen nog liepen de special inspector general liet zich in zijn rapport van maart

nl|d d juli liet de special inspector general zich kritisch uit over de bereikte resultaten
nl|per eind februari waren er permanente modifications op een totaal van trial modifications vanaf het
nl|begin van bleken amerikaanse banken eerder dan voorheen bereid te zijn om mee te werken
nl|aan short sales waarbij een huis verkocht werd voor minder dan het bedrag van de
nl|hypotheek hiermee werden veilingen die vermoedelijk tot een nog lagere opbrengst zouden leiden voorkomen in
nl|maart kondigde de amerikaanse regering diverse maatregelen aan om een hernieuwd inzakken van de woningmarkt
nl|te voorkomen waaronder subsidie aan banken voor het gedeeltelijk afschrijven van leningen deze maatregelen zouden
nl|circa miljard kosten vanaf het voorjaar van werden steeds meer signalen vernomen dat amerikaanse huiseigenaren
nl|ertoe overgingen de hypotheek niet meer te betalen en het op een gedwongen verkoop lieten
nl|aankomen strategic default de periode tussen het stoppen met betalen en de veiling van het
nl|huis was vooral door de toegenomen werklast bij de banken en in die staten waar
nl|een rechterlijke machtiging vereist was de gerechten toegenomen tot vaak ruim een jaar een functionaris
nl|van fannie mae sprak in juni van een disturbing trend toward strategic defaulting amerikaanse banken
nl|hadden grote moeite om de zelf ingekochte huizen verkocht te krijgen fannie mae lanceerde in
nl|september een programma geheten homepath waarbij kopers van door fannie mae ingekochte woningen opmerkelijk soepele
nl|hypotheken werd aangeboden slechts eigen geld en een fico score van terwijl op dat moment
nl|een minimum van gebruikelijk was in het rapport over het derde kwartaal van uitte de
nl|special inspector general in sterke bewoordingen kritiek op de uitvoering van het tarp programma de
nl|doelstellingen werden niet verwezenlijkt de voordelen kwamen vooral op wall street terecht de rapportages door
nl|de treasury waren misleidend vanaf circa september bleek sprake van juridische complicaties rond de gedwongen
nl|verkoop bij betalingsachterstanden op hypotheken er bleek veelvuldig sprake te zijn van ten minste administratieve
nl|onvolkomenheden een centrale rol hierbij speelde het mortgage electronic registration system dat opgezet was om
nl|de overdracht van hypotheken te vereenvoudigen l de vraag of de registratie in het mers
nl|juridisch toereikend was werd door diverse amerikaanse rechters verschillend beantwoord bij verkoop van de lening
nl|zou dan echter de situatie kunnen blijken te zijn ontstaan dat wel de vordering op
nl|de huiseigenaar was overgegaan op de nieuwe crediteur maar niet het bijbehorende hypotheekrecht gedwongen verkoop
nl|van de woning zou dan niet mogelijk zijn en de crediteur zou slechts een normale
nl|vordering op de huiseigenaar die mogelijk weinig verhaal zou bieden overhouden dit was voor opvolgende
nl|houders van de gesecuritiseerde vorderingen reden om aan te dringen op het terugdraaien van die
nl|verkoop de verkoper had ze een lening met een essentieel gebrek verkocht dit leidde tot
nl|een groot aantal rechtszaken waarin rechters soms geheel tegengestelde beslissingen namen voor dit geheel aan
nl|complicaties raakte de term foreclosuregate in zwang in februari presenteerde de amerikaanse regering plannen om
nl|op termijn te komen tot opheffing van freddie mac en fannie mae de betrokkenheid van
nl|de amerikaanse overheid was intussen zeer ver opgelopen tezamen met de federal housing administration waren
nl|freddie mac en fannie mae betrokken bij van de nieuw verstrekte hypotheken de amerikaanse belastingbetaler
nl|had inmiddels circa miljard aan verliezen van beide instellingen aangezuiverd verwacht werd echter dat enige
nl|vorm van terugtrekking meerdere jaren in beslag zou nemen overheden in eigenlijk alle door de
nl|crisis getroffen landen gingen in de loop van de tijd een veel grotere rol spelen
nl|dan enkele jaren daarvoor voor mogelijk zou zijn gehouden hierbij wordt aangetekend dat de ernst
nl|van de crisis naar achteraf vastgesteld kan worden door beleidsmakers onderschat is fed voorzitter bernanke
nl|zei op juli dat de situatie rond subprime leningen ernstig doch grotendeels beheerst was grave
nl|but largely contained en imf directeur dominique strauss kahn zei op mei tegen een commissie
nl|van het europees parlement in brussel dat het hoogtepunt van de kredietcrisis achter de rug
nl|is maar dat de gevolgen nog maandenlang voelbaar zouden zijn het imf schreef in het
nl|global financial stability report van april dat er enige indicaties waren van een terugkerend vertrouwen
nl|in de financi le markten maar dat verdergaande overheidsmaatregelen nodig waren de raming van het
nl|totaal aan afschrijvingen werd verhoogd tot ruim miljard overheden en centrale banken m zijn op
nl|diverse wijzen betrokken geweest bij de crisis de effecten van dat optreden zijn moeilijk te
nl|meten reeds omdat niet bekend is wat de situatie zou zijn indien dat optreden achterwege
nl|gebleven was in het algemeen kan gesteld worden dat een neveneffect wel is geweest dat
nl|de negatieve gevolgen van een risicovolle bedrijfsvoering in diverse gevallen werd afgewenteld op de samenleving
nl|terwijl dergelijke negatieve effecten zich ook in de toekomst nog op grote schaal kunnen gaan
nl|voordoen bijvoorbeeld indien overheden schadeclaims voortvloeiend uit door hen verstrekte garanties moeten uitbetalen de vormen
nl|van betrokkenheid kunnen worden onderscheiden in sinds het begin van de crisis hebben diverse centrale
nl|banken diverse malen de offici le rentetarieven verlaagd soms met opmerkelijk grote stappen n in
nl|de vs belandde de offici le rente op een extreem laag niveau op december verlaagde
nl|de federal reserve de federal funds rate tot een target rate tussen en deze historisch
nl|lage offici le rentes werden in ieder geval tot in dus historisch onvergelijkbaar lang volgehouden
nl|ook nadat oplopende inflatie vanaf eind begin onder normale omstandigheden tot een verhoging van die
nl|rentes zou hebben geleid dit speelde met name in het verenigd koninkrijk waar de bank
nl|of england de base rate ondanks een fors stijgende inflatie gedurende geruime tijd op liet
nl|de ecb verhoogde op april met ingang van april de refi rate van tot en
nl|in juli nogmaals met in november en december verlaagde men de rente telkens met basispunten
nl|tot de federal reserve hield op dat moment de federal funds rate op het bestaande
nl|niveau hoewel diverse fed bestuurders hierover tegengestelde meningen bleken te hebben de amerikaanse overheid paste
nl|driemaal een fiscale stimulans toe vanaf mei een pakket aan tax rebates van circa miljard
nl|eind juli een pakket steunmaatregelen van circa miljard de housing and economic recovery act en
nl|in februari een pakket van miljard american recovery and reinvestment act of het eerste programma
nl|bestond uit een zuivere fiscale impuls een directe belastingverlaging in de vorm van negatieve belastingaanslagen
nl|voor iedere amerikaan het tweede pakket was met name gericht op het verschaffen van vervangende
nl|hypotheken voor huiseigenaren die in moeilijkheden waren komen te verkeren het derde pakket bestond uit

nl|te gaan verstrekken eind juni werd miljard verstrekt tot juli eind september werd een faciliteit
nl|van miljard tot oktober hieraan toegevoegd voorts was opmerkelijk dat de door de centrale banken
nl|geaccepteerde onderpanden in de loop van de tijd aanmerkelijk versoepeld zijn normaliter worden tegenover dit
nl|soort voorschotten slechts staatsleningen als onderpand geaccepteerd doch inmiddels ook geheel andere soorten onderpanden een
nl|geheel nieuwe fase ging in op oktober toen de federal reserve de commercial paper funding
nl|facility aankondigde waarbij men zich bereid verklaarde om door amerikaanse ondernemingen uitgegeven kortlopend schuldpapier op
nl|te nemen een dergelijk optreden van een centrale bank als bankier van het bedrijfsleven dus
nl|niet als bankier van het bankwezen is opmerkelijk doch bleek later niet uniek de bank
nl|of japan besloot op december tot uitbreiding van de geaccepteerde onderpanden tot bbb gerate leningen
nl|ten laste van ondernemingen nadat het bankwezen eenmaal aan het bestaan van dergelijke faciliteiten gewend
nl|was geraakt leek het moeilijk deze terug te schroeven de ecb kondigde in de herfst
nl|van aan de onderpandwaarde van sommige categorie n onderpanden te verlagen doch eerst vanaf februari
nl|in april kondigde de ecb aan meer details te verlangen omtrent de achterliggende hypotheken van
nl|in onderpand gegeven leningen begin november lieten de bank of england en de ecb weten
nl|hun faciliteiten geleidelijk te willen terugschroeven de bank of japan had enkele dagen eerder bericht
nl|de aankoop van bedrijfsobligaties te zullen staken op december kondigde de ecb aan op december
nl|voor het laatst een jaars faciliteit te verschaffen en de maandenfaciliteiten geleidelijk af te schaffen
nl|er was op dat moment voor miljard aan voorschotten verstrekt deze faciliteit bedroeg miljard de
nl|afloop van de jaarfaciliteit van miljard op juli zorgde niet voor noemenswaardige problemen op de
nl|europese geldmarkt tijdens en vanaf de crisis rond griekse staatsleningen accepteerde de ecb griekse staatsleningen
nl|als onderpand hoewel ze niet aan de minimale ratingeis voldeden ten tijde van de bijna
nl|crisis rond ierse staatsleningen in november bleek dat de ecb op grote schaal optrad als
nl|financier van het ierse bankwezen per eind oktober bleken ierse banken in totaal circa miljard
nl|bij de ecb te hebben geleend centrale banken en overheden zijn diverse malen opgetreden als
nl|bemiddelaar en regisseur o bij overnames van financi le instellingen in sommige gevallen leidde dit
nl|tot een betrokkenheid van de overheid of centrale bank in de vorm van verschaffer van
nl|garanties of verschaffer van krediet voor die overname dit was bijvoorbeeld bij de overname van
nl|bear stearns het geval de federal deposit insurance corporation sloot veelvuldig loss sharing arrangements met
nl|banken die insolvente banken overnamen in feite kwam dit neer op het voor rekening van
nl|de overheid brengen van aanmerkelijke te verwachten verliezen op met name onroerend goed en hypotheken
nl|een bijzondere rol speelden de beide amerikaanse government sponsored enterprises fannie mae en freddie mac
nl|beiden zeer grote verstrekkers of garanten van hypotheken p hoewel er geen expliciete overheidsgarantie was
nl|werd algemeen aangenomen dat de amerikaanse overheid een faillissement van deze instellingen zou wensen te
nl|vermijden reeds vanwege de omvang van deze instellingen op juli kreeg een omvangrijk pakket aan
nl|maatregelen kracht van wet waarvan de uiteindelijke financi le gevolgen voor de amerikaanse overheid niet
nl|op voorhand vast te stellen zijn op grond van deze wet kan de amerikaanse overheid
nl|omvangrijke bedragen aan freddie mac en fannie mae lenen en kan de amerikaanse overheid aandelen
nl|in deze ondernemingen kopen op september ging deze betrokkenheid een nieuwe fase in doordat freddie
nl|mac en fannie mae in conservatorship werden geplaatst nadat uit een onderzoek was gebleken dat
nl|beide instellingen aanzienlijk minder vermogen bezaten dan door de toezichthouder als minimumvermogen regulatory capital was
nl|voorgeschreven de federal housing finance agency nam de leiding over de ceo s werden ontslagen
nl|de amerikaanse regering zegde toe voor zodanige bedragen aan preferente aandelen te kopen als nodig
nl|mocht zijn voor het behouden van een toereikend eigen vermogen de hiermee gemoeide bedragen beliepen
nl|een maximum van miljard per instelling naast een voorziening van miljard in februari werden deze
nl|bedragen verdubbeld tot miljard per instelling de betrokkenheid van de amerikaanse overheid bij de verstrekking
nl|van hypotheken via fannie mae freddie mac ginnie mae en de federal housing administration nam
nl|zeer grote vormen aan in de herfst van bleek dat van alle nieuw verstrekte hypotheken
nl|circa afkomstig was van deze vier instellingen waar de overheid op verschillende wijzen direct onderdeel
nl|van de overheid grootaandeelhouder garant of de facto garant bij betrokken was op december werd
nl|bekend dat de amerikaanse overheid de verliezen van freddie mac en fannie mae in de
nl|jaren en ongeacht de omvang daarvan zou compenseren in zijn rapport van januari aan het
nl|amerikaanse congres merkte de special inspector general van het tarp programma op the federal government
nl|has long played an important role in financing residential housing and that role has increased
nl|dramatically since the outset of the crisis with the federal government and the organizations it
nl|backs now guaranteeing or insuring almost all net new borrowings for mortgages and mortgagebacked securities
nl|mbs in other words the government has done more than simply support the mortgage market
nl|in many ways it has become the mortgage market with the taxpayer shouldering the risk
nl|that had once been borne by the private investor medio juni werd bekend dat de
nl|amerikaanse overheid inmiddels voor miljard aan verliezen bij freddie mac en fannie mae had aangezuiverd
nl|schattingen omtrent de totale schade liepen uiteen van miljard tot miljard naarmate de crisis intensiveerde
nl|nam de mate waarin overheden direct deelnamen in het risicodragend kapitaal van financi le instellingen
nl|toe te noemen zijn de nationalisatie van de britse hypotheekbank northern rock de omvangrijke deelname
nl|van de amerikaanse overheid in de amerikaanse verzekeraar aig plannen van de britse spaanse en
nl|nederlandse overheden om voor respectievelijk gbp miljard tot gbp miljard q eur miljard en eur
nl|miljard deel te nemen in het aandelenkapitaal van diverse banken en de overname van abn
nl|amro en de nederlandse fortis activiteiten door de nederlandse overheid op oktober werd dit uitgebreid
nl|met deelnames door onder meer de duitse regering op oktober presenteerde de amerikaanse regering een
nl|plan deel uitmakend van het amerikaans economisch reddingsplan om voor miljard deel te nemen in
nl|het kapitaal van amerikaanse banken waarvan voor miljard in het kapitaal van grote amerikaanse banken
nl|in kleinere regionale amerikaanse banken werd voor miljard deelgenomen de ierse regering stak in december
nl|miljard in de bankensector in de vorm van perpetuele preferente aandelen in bank of ireland
nl|allied irish banks en anglo irish bank met een coupon van resp r in januari
nl|kondigde de franse regering aan voor miljard deel te nemen in het aandelenkapitaal van een
nl|aantal franse banken een van de voorwaarden hierbij was dat de bestuurders zouden afzien van
nl|enige bonus in februari converteerde de amerikaanse regering miljard aan preferente aandelen in citigroup gekocht
nl|bij een eerdere reddingsactie in gewone aandelen hiermee verkreeg men een overheidsbelang van circa in
nl|citigroup begin maart kreeg verzekeraar aig voor de derde maal overheidssteun eveneens onder meer in
nl|de vorm van omzetting van preferente aandelen in gewone aandelen s in juni betaalden een
nl|vijftal amerikaanse banken in totaal miljard terug waarmee de directe overheidsbetrokkenheid bij die banken weer
nl|grotendeels werd be indigd ook andere banken streefden naar terugbetaling van staatssteun aangezien een zekere
nl|mate van restrictief beloningsbeleid meestal onderdeel vormde van de voorwaarden voor het verkrijgen van die
nl|staatssteun deelname van een overheid in het risicodragend kapitaal van banken kan uiteindelijk leiden tot
nl|volledige nationalisering de grens tussen beide maatregelen is echter vloeiend aangezien de mate van zeggenschap
nl|niet uitsluitend afhangt van het aandeel in het aandeelhouderschap maar ook van zaken als benoeming
nl|van topbestuurders vanaf de herfst van bleek dat de europese commissie aan de staatssteun regelmatig
nl|de voorwaarde stelde dat banken bedrijfsonderdelen zouden afstoten dit was onder meer het geval bij
nl|ing groep lloyds en rbs de ierse regering kondigde in januari aan de anglo irish
nl|bank te nationaliseren deskundigen zouden vaststellen of de aandeelhouders gegeven de waarde van de onderneming
nl|aanspraak zouden kunnen maken op enige vergoeding dit bleek echter niet voldoende te zijn anglo
nl|irish bank berichtte op augustus in september circa miljard aan steun nodig te hebben voor
nl|de terugbetaling van in september vervallende leningen op maart droeg de ierse regering de ierse
nl|banken op om binnen dagen miljard aan nieuw kapitaal aan te trekken de noodzaak hiertoe
nl|was ontstaan nadat gebleken was dat de waarde van aan de bad bank nama over
nl|te dragen dubieuze leningen aanzienlijk lager was dan gedacht de gemiddelde korting van de eerste
nl|tranche van miljard bedroeg terwijl anglo irish bank verwachtte dit veroorzaakte extra verliezen bij de
nl|banken wat met een kapitaaluitbreiding diende te worden opgevangen de verwachting was dat een aanmerkelijk
nl|deel daarvan voor rekening van de ierse regering zou komen in september bleek dat anglo
nl|irish bank nog vele miljarden aan staatssteun behoefde hierop besloot de ierse regering nadat in
nl|de voorgaande dagen de koersen van ierse staatsleningen sterk gedaald waren op september de bank
nl|te splitsen in een funding bank die de bestaande activiteiten op beperkte schaal zou voortzetten
nl|en een asset recovery bank die zou trachten te problematische leningen te liquideren tegen zo
nl|laag mogelijke kosten voor de belastingbetaler in maart bleek na het uitvoeren van extra stresstests
nl|dat vier ierse banken nogmaals overheidssteun nodig hadden in de vorm van aandelenkapitaal tot een
nl|bedrag van miljard waarmee het totaal van hetgeen de overheid in banken gestoken had uitkwam
nl|op miljard t door het opkopen van illiquide vorderingen eigendom van banken beogen overheden om
nl|daarmee de mogelijkheden van banken nieuw krediet te verstrekken te vergroten tevens tracht men hiermee
nl|te voorkomen dat door banken de zeer lage prijzen die tot stand komen bij de
nl|wel gedane transacties algemeen gehanteerd moeten worden bij de waardering van beleggingen het doel is
nl|deze beleggingen op enig moment weer te verkopen de vraag of dat zal slagen en
nl|of dat gepaard gaat met een verlies voor de belastingbetaler is thans niet te beantwoorden
nl|het grootste initiatief op dit gebied is het troubled asset relief program verwerkt in de
nl|emergency economic stabilization act in de vs ten bedrage van miljard van dit bedrag werd
nl|een deel later bestemd voor versterking van het kapitaal van amerikaanse banken het aankopen van
nl|giftige leningen werd op de lange baan geschoven het congres bleek hier niet van gediend
nl|de spaanse overheid kondigde begin oktober een fonds aan van miljard tot miljard de zwitserse
nl|overheid steunde de zwitserse bank ubs bij het oprichten van een fonds waarin illiquide leningen
nl|werden gestald in zijn persbericht van december kondigde de federal reserve aan de komende kwartalen
nl|grote bedragen aan leningen van agencies en mortgage backed securities te zullen opkopen vanaf begin
nl|januari werd hiermee door de federal reserve bank of new york begonnen begin september waren
nl|leningen met een nominaal bedrag van circa miljard gekocht de ecb kondigde op mei aan
nl|covered bonds te zullen gaan opkopen zulks tot een bedrag van miljard begin juli berichtte
nl|de ecb dat dit programma voltooid was de gekochte leningen zouden tot het einde van
nl|de looptijd worden aangehouden de leningen hadden een duur van tot jaar met een gemiddelde
nl|duur van jaar een in relatie tot de omvang van de economie van het betrokken
nl|land zeer omvangrijke transactie werd op september aangekondigd toen de ierse regering bekendmaakte dat de
nl|national asset management agency voor miljard aan onroerend goed gerelateerde leningen met een nominaal bedrag
nl|van miljard zou overnemen van ierse banken teneinde die banken in staat te stellen het
nl|verstrekken van leningen te hervatten de actuele marktwaarde van de leningen werd op miljard geraamd
nl|doch men maakte voor de bepaling van de overnamesom gebruik van de long term economic
nl|value de banken zouden betaald worden met obligaties ten laste van nama die aan de
nl|ecb verkocht zouden kunnen worden op november werd deze transactie door het ierse parlement goedgekeurd
nl|in oktober werd besloten dat de ecb nogmaals nu voor miljard covered bonds zou gaan
nl|opkopen de federal reserve kondigde op november een programma aan geheten term asset backed securities
nl|loan facility talf op grond waarvan tot een bedrag van miljard leningen zouden worden verstrekt
nl|aan houders van aaa gerate asset backed securities op februari werd bekend dat dit bedrag
nl|werd verhoogd tot miljard en werd de omvang uitgebreid tot nieuw verstrekte asset backed securities
nl|met onder meer commercieel onroerend goed als onderpand in augustus werd de looptijd van het
nl|programma verlengd op maart werd een gewijzigde versie van dit plan gepresenteerd onder de naam
nl|public private investment program waarbij ook het door private partijen opkopen van reeds bestaande leningen
nl|werd gefaciliteerd de amerikaanse overheid zou hiervoor zowel leningen verstrekken als deelnemen in het risicodragend
nl|vermogen van de koper het doel hiervan was enerzijds om de balansen van banken te
nl|ontlasten van illiquide leningen en anderzijds om de markt in illiquide leningen weer op gang
nl|te brengen zulks mede teneinde marktprijzen tot stand te doen komen die dan weer gebruikt
nl|zouden kunnen worden voor het waarderen van andere activa medio juni waren uit hoofde van
nl|dit programma leningen tot een bedrag van circa miljard verstrekt in een aantal gevallen stelden
nl|overheden zich garant voor leningen aan in moeilijkheden verkerende financi le instellingen bijvoorbeeld bij de
nl|duitse hypotheekbank hypo real estate waar de duitse overheid als onderdeel van een reddingsplan een
nl|garantie b rgschaftsrahmen verstrekte van miljard later werd deze garantie aanmerkelijk uitgebreid in september kwam
nl|door een aanvullende garantie van miljard het totaal op miljard de ierse regering garandeerde eind
nl|september vrijwel alle spaartegoeden deposito s en uitstaande leningen van ierse banken in september werd
nl|de looptijd van deze garantie verlengd in september werd deze garantie verlengd tot eind in
nl|november tot eind juni in aanvulling op het kapitaalprogramma van oktober stelde de amerikaanse overheid
nl|zich garant voor nieuw uit te geven leningen tot juli voor een periode van drie
nl|jaar hiermee was potentieel een bedrag gemoeid van miljard bovendien stelde de vs zich garant
nl|voor miljard aan renteloze leningen aan meest kleinere ondernemingen per oktober was miljard aan leningen
nl|ge mitteerd die gegarandeerd waren door overheden in de eurozone in een aantal gevallen verstrekten
nl|overheden garanties aan in moeilijkheden verkerende banken ten aanzien van de waarde van leningen in
nl|hun beleggingsportefeuilles hiermee werd bereikt dat die banken op die leningen geen verdere afschrijvingen hoefden
nl|te verrichten welke afschrijvingen tot gevolg zouden hebben gehad dat hun garantievermogen verder geslonken zou
nl|zijn dergelijke garanties werden onder meer verstrekt door de amerikaanse overheid aan citigroup ten aanzien
nl|van miljard aan leningen en door de nederlandse overheid aan ing groep in januari ten
nl|aanzien van miljard aan amerikaanse alt a hypotheken zie tevens hieronder de meest omvangrijke uitbreiding
nl|van het toezicht vond plaats in ijsland waar op oktober de gehele bankensector onder toezicht
nl|werd gesteld u op oktober werd de op een na grootste bank van ijsland genationaliseerd
nl|in de daarop volgende maanden werden ook andere ijslandse banken door de regering overgenomen de
nl|amerikaanse regering stelde in maart voor het toezicht uit te breiden tot alle in de
nl|financi le sector werkzame ondernemingen niet zijnde banken waarvan een faillissement een risico voor het
nl|financi le systeem zou kunnen vormen in juni kondigde president obama vergaande hervormingen van het
nl|toezichtstelsel aan op juli nam de amerikaanse senaat na circa een jaar van voorbereiding en
nl|veelvuldige wijzigingen de financial reform bill aan die het toezicht op de financi le sector
nl|beoogde te versterken het wetsontwerp was aangegroeid tot pagina s en voorzag onder meer in
nl|de oprichting van een consumer financial protection agency de financi le sector die tientallen miljoenen
nl|dollars had besteed aan lobby activiteiten sprak zijn teleurstelling uit op juli werd de wet
nl|van kracht op september bereikte europa overeenstemming over het oprichten van nieuwe toezichthouders voor banken
nl|verzekeraars en beurzen de hoogte van het bedrag tot hetwelk een spaartegoed wordt gegarandeerd is
nl|uiteraard van invloed op de bereidheid van spaarders hun geld aan banken toe te vertrouwen
nl|europese overheden hanteerden verschillende bedragen als maximum hetgeen leidt tot een zekere concurrentie tussen landen
nl|uiteindelijk werd het plafond van de garantie op gesteld in de vs werd dit de
nl|kosten van een dergelijke garantie plegen bestreden te worden uit een nationaal fonds dat door
nl|de banken in dat land gevoed wordt bij een groot faillissement van een bank is
nl|het echter niet denkbeeldig dat de overheid zou moeten bijspringen in de vs deed de
nl|federal deposit insurance corporation uit haar deposit insurance fund aanmerkelijke betalingen aan banken die insolvente
nl|banken overnamen zulks teneinde gewone faillissementen te voorkomen die zouden tot grotere betalingen aan spaarders
nl|en rekeninghouders hebben geleid het gevolg was dat het deposit insurance funds snel in omvang
nl|terugliep per juni had het fonds een omvang van van de verplichtingen terwijl dat voor
nl|de crisis circa was geweest v bij kwantitatieve versoepeling vergroot een centrale bank de geldhoeveelheid
nl|door leningen in de markt op te kopen in theorie zijn dit staatsleningen doch in
nl|de praktijk pleegt men ook andere leningen te kopen de hiermee vrijkomende liquiditeiten zouden dan
nl|kunnen worden gebruikt voor het verstrekken van nieuwe kredieten de britse centrale bank kondigde in
nl|maart aan voornemens te zijn voor gbp miljard aan staatsobligaties te kopen wat in mei
nl|werd uitgebreid tot gbp miljard en later tot gbp miljard ook de bank of japan
nl|kocht voor miljard evenals de federal reserve die in maart aankondigde voor miljard aan staatsleningen
nl|te gaan kopen en voor een additionele miljard aan andere leningen op november verhoogde de
nl|bank of england het budget tot gbp miljard in de herfst van werden steeds meer
nl|signalen opgevangen dat de federal reserve vanaf november een nieuwe ronde van quantitative easing zou
nl|starten tevens wenste men de verwachtingen omtrent de toekomstige inflatie te laten stijgen hierdoor zouden
nl|consumenten worden aangezet tot extra consumptie op november maakte de federal reserve bekend tot juni
nl|voor miljard aan staatsleningen met looptijden van vijf tot zes jaar te gaan kopen in
nl|maandelijkse bedragen van circa miljard op mei besloten de eu lidstaten en de ecb ter
nl|beteugeling van de crisis rond griekse staatsleningen en om te voorkomen dat die zou overslaan
nl|naar andere landen met name portugal en spanje dat de ecb rechtstreeks staatsleningen zou opkopen
nl|teneinde daarmee een bodem in de markt te leggen tegenover deze aankopen waarmee de geldhoeveelheid
nl|toenam zou de ecb leningsfaciliteiten aan het bankwezen met een gelijk bedrag verminderen w aanvankelijk
nl|werd voor circa miljard per week gekocht later nam dit tempo af in september was
nl|voor circa miljard gekocht in augustus kondigde de federal reserve aan de te ontvangen aflossingen
nl|van mortgage backed securities te zullen herbeleggen in staatsleningen waarbij het minimum aan in portefeuille
nl|gehouden beleggingen van miljard werd gesteld x vanaf augustus ging de ecb na een pauze
nl|van enkele maanden op voorheen ongekend grote schaal italiaanse en in mindere mate spaanse en
nl|portugese staatsleningen opkopen medio november was voor miljard gekocht zie hierover tevens europese staatsschuldencrisis naarmate
nl|de kredietcrisis meer overging in een beginnende recessie kondigden diverse overheden steunmaatregelen af of vroegen
nl|ondernemingen om dergelijke steun hoewel dit deels te zien is als een klassiek contra cyclisch
nl|beleid werd in een aantal gevallen de moeilijke verkrijgbaarheid van krediet als reden voor een
nl|dergelijke maatregel of verzoek genoemd de duitse overheid presenteerde in november een pakket aan maatregelen
nl|van eur miljard de britse overheid een van gbp miljard de europese commissie een van
nl|eur miljard en de chinese overheid kondigde een pakket aan ten bedrage van miljard yuan
nl|in april kondigden de europese commissie en de lidstaten van de eu aan om samen
nl|met het imf griekenland miljard te lenen ter beteugeling van de crisis rond de griekse
nl|overheidsfinanci n op april werd dit uitgebreid tot een algemeen pakket van in totaal miljard
nl|zie europese staatsschuldencrisis diverse landen per begin december oekra ne ijsland pakistan en hongarije wendden
nl|zich tot het imf met het verzoek om financi le steun in februari verstrekten de
nl|wereldbank de europese investeringsbank en de european bank for reconstruction and development tezamen leningen van
nl|miljard aan banken in centraal en oost europa een verzoek van hongarije om een gezamenlijk
nl|europees reddingsplan van miljard werd op maart afgewezen in april verzocht mexico om een lening
nl|van miljard teneinde deze steunverlening mogelijk te maken besloot de g het kapitaal van het
nl|imf uit te breiden met miljard polen verzocht het imf om een lening van miljard
nl|roemeni verkreeg in mei een lening van het imf van miljard griekenland kreeg in april
nl|miljard steun van het imf terwijl het imf aan het steunpakket voor de zwakkere eurozone
nl|landen van mei deelnam voor miljard volgens sommige berichten miljard op april kondigde het imf
nl|een uitbreiding van de new arrangement to borrow aan van miljard tot miljard op augustus
nl|kondigde het imf een nieuwe faciliteit aan precautionary credit line waarbij potenti le geldvragende lidstaten
nl|reeds vooraf de kwalificatieprocedure zouden doorlopen zodat een eventueel beroep op die faciliteit dan zeer
nl|snel afgehandeld zou kunnen worden de toegenomen betrokkenheid van centrale banken leidde tot een sterke
nl|toename van hun balanstotalen hoewel het balanstotaal van het eurosysteem later weer enigszins afnam de
nl|balanstotalen van de federal reserve en het eurosysteem y ontwikkelden zich als in de grafieken
nl|aangegeven de toename van de balanstotalen vloeide niet alleen voort uit de toename van de
nl|voorschotten aan normale banken doch ook aan min of meer verkapte steunoperaties waarbij banken leningen
nl|bij centrale banken opnamen tegen onderpand van mogelijk problematische leningen teneinde daarmee hun balans te
nl|ontlasten ook andere steunoperaties waren zichtbaar op de balans de balans van de federal reserve
nl|ging voor een gestaag toenemend deel bestaan uit langer lopende leningen waaronder een groot bedrag
nl|aan leningen die verband hielden met hypotheken in begin waren de kortlopende steunprogramma s van
nl|de federal reserve voor het merendeel afgebouwd of waren ze nadat er slechts in geringe
nl|mate gebruik van was gemaakt ingetrokken een geenszins uitputtend overzicht van steunmaatregelen waartoe in het
nl|kader van de kredietcrisis is besloten is te vinden op steunmaatregelen in het kader van
nl|de kredietcrisis vanaf december ontstond er in amerika bezorgdheid over het gebrek aan transparantie rond
nl|de verschillende programma s van de fed en de treasury bailouts er werden vele miljarden
nl|aan belastinggeld uitgegeven terwijl bijvoorbeeld de fed niet wilde zeggen waar het geld precies naartoe
nl|ging een verzoek van bloomberg aan de fed om informatie over elf programma s met
nl|een beroep op de freedom of information act werd afgewezen onder meer met het argument
nl|dat het nadelige gevolgen voor de economie zou hebben de door het congres ingestelde onderzoekscommissie
nl|congressional oversight panel liet zich meerdere malen kritisch uit over de mate van transparantie en
nl|over het inzicht in het effect van de diverse maatregelen tot op dat moment in
nl|april wendde bloomberg zich nogmaals tot de rechter in augustus wees de rechter dit verzoek
nl|toe de federal reserve diende details omtrent de diverse reddingsoperaties te verstrekken met name omtrent
nl|de identiteit van ontvangers van overheidssteun en omtrent de in onderpand genomen zekerheden doch verleende
nl|enkele dagen later de fed een uitstel tot september om in beroep te gaan eind
nl|september kreeg de federal reserve toestemming van de solictor general voor hoger beroep tegen dit
nl|vonnis in januari wendde de federal reserve zich tot de appelrechter met het verzoek de
nl|uitspraak van augustus te vernietigen op maart gaf de fed een aantal gegevens vrij de
nl|zekerheden die men had ontvangen bij de steun aan jp morgan bij de overname van
nl|bear stearns bleken in hoofdzaak te bestaan uit hypotheken van zeer twijfelachtige kwaliteit op augustus
nl|verzocht de federal reserve de appelrechter om de verplichting tot het openbaar maken van de
nl|namen van de bij de hierboven genoemde steunverlening betrokken banken dagen op te schorten aangezien
nl|dat kon leiden tot een vertrouwensverlies wat zou kunnen leiden tot bank runs en faillissementen
nl|het verzoek van de federal reserve volgde op een afwijzing op augustus van een verzoek
nl|tot het opnieuw beoordelen van het oorspronkelijke verzoek van bloomberg dat in hoger beroep was
nl|toegewezen het verzoek werd toegestaan op oktober beklaagde bloomberg zich dat de wijze waarop de
nl|amerikaanse overheid informatie had verstrekt te wensen overliet op pagina s uitgeprinte e mails waren
nl|alle details omtrent feitelijke transacties onleesbaar gemaakt eerst in december gaf de rederal reserve details
nl|omtrent een aantal transacties in de periode december juli vrij opmerkelijk was dat de commercial
nl|paper funding facility in hoofdzaak door niet amerikaanse banken gebruikt was waaronder de rabobank op
nl|maart gaf de federal reserve een groot aantal documenten vrij met details omtrent het gebruik
nl|van de discount window facility door banken in en nadat dit door het supreme court
nl|was bevolen de kredietcrisis deed zich in nederland en belgi zeer duidelijk voelen bij de
nl|problemen die bank verzekeraar fortis ondervond bij het verkrijgen van voldoende kapitaal voor de financiering
nl|van het aankoopbedrag dat het voor abn amro verschuldigd was de beurskoers van fortis had
nl|hier ernstig onder te lijden z uiteindelijk werd in het weekend van en september besloten
nl|tot een gedeeltelijke nationalisatie van de bank verzekeraar er bleek een deelname van drie overheden
nl|aa nodig te zijn om aan kennelijk onmiddellijk dreigende problemen het hoofd te bieden naar
nl|medio november bleek haalden vooral zakelijke rekeninghouders op grote schaal hun geld weg bij fortis
nl|waardoor een acuut en omvangrijk liquiditeitstekort ontstond waarvoor een noodkrediet van de nederlandse en belgische
nl|centrale banken nodig was ten bedrage van miljard op vrijdag oktober kondigde de nederlandse staat
nl|de overname aan van alle nederlandse activiteiten van fortis inclusief het gedeelte van abn amro
nl|dat eigendom was van fortis voor een bedrag van miljard op zondag oktober werd bekendgemaakt
nl|dat de franse bank bnp paribas het grootste deel van de belgische en luxemburgse activiteiten
nl|van fortis kocht de handel in aandelen fortis werd een week lang opgeschort toen op
nl|oktober de handel hervat werd bleek het aandeel lager te openen in belgi hadden veel
nl|burgers aandelen in fortis er zijn verschillende juridische acties ondernomen om compensatie te verkrijgen voor
nl|de geleden verliezen deze acties bestonden uit rechtszaken over misinformatie door het bestuur van fortis
nl|voordat de problemen van fortis in de openbaarheid kwamen en rechtszaken over de wijze waarop
nl|fortis van een mogelijk faillissement gered is fortis bank belgi rapporteerde op januari over de
nl|eerste drie kwartalen van een nettoverlies van miljard voor het vierde kwartaal verwachtte men een
nl|verlies van tot miljard de nederlandse overheid berichtte op november nogmaals geld in abn amro
nl|te steken ditmaal miljard voorts zette men miljard aan leningen om in eigen vermogen toenmalig

nl|crisis was avoidable it found widespread failures in financial regulation dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance
nl|excessive borrowing and risk taking by households and wall street policy makers who were ill
nl|prepared for the crisis and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels de
nl|commissie deed geen aanbevelingen omtrent maatregelen naar aanleiding van haar bevindingen zulks in overeenstemming met
nl|haar opdracht het beleg van deventer vond plaats tijdens de tachtigjarige oorlog in het jaar
nl|de stad deventer werd gedurende enkele maanden belegerd door staatse troepen onder leiding van george
nl|van lalaing graaf van rennenberg de belegering begon op augustus en maakte deel uit van
nl|het besluit van de staten generaal om de gewesten holland en utrecht beter te beschermen
nl|tegen plunderingen in de stad was al sinds het duitse polweiler regiment gelegerd dat in
nl|opdracht van landvoogd don juan van oostenrijk de stad voor de spanjaarden verdedigde nadat de
nl|graaf van rennenberg een aantal strategische adviezen van johan van den kornput had toegepast was
nl|de stad bereid tot onderhandelingen over een overgave op november gaf de stad zich over
nl|aan de staatse troepen deventer had in de middeleeuwen een hoge status in de nederlanden
nl|en het was de belangrijkste plaats in overijssel deventer had al vroeg stadsrechten die waarschijnlijk
nl|voor het eerst werden vastgelegd in de e eeuw de stad was een van de
nl|eerste nederlandse steden die zich aansloot bij het hanzeverbond waardoor het een belangrijke handels en
nl|stapelplaats werd er werd onder andere met het noorse bergen handel gedreven in stokvis tot
nl|ver in de e eeuw waren er in deventer vijf jaarmarkten waar werd gehandeld in
nl|vele goederen zoals linnen pelzen hout en zandsteen steden in de omgeving profiteerden van de
nl|gedreven handel en ontvingen tolinkomsten op religieus vlak had deventer ook een voorname rol van
nl|invloed hierop was onder meer dat geert grote grondlegger van de moderne devotie in de
nl|e eeuw in de stad woonde hij zette diverse instellingen op die bijdroegen aan de
nl|verspreiding van het humanisme vanuit onder meer deventer de stad kende meteen na het uitvinden
nl|van de boekdrukkunst een aantal actieve boekdrukkers ook in de kerkelijke organisatie was deventer belangrijk
nl|bij de herindeling van bisdommen in werd deventer aangewezen als een van de bisdomzetels in
nl|de nederlanden door die grote economische en religieuze belangen had de stad vanouds veel invloed
nl|in het voormalige oversticht en het verdere achterland de toekomst had op beide gebieden voor
nl|deventer echter weinig goeds in petto deventer was een ommuurde vestingstad gelegen op drie rivierduinen
nl|aan de ijssel de ommuring bestond uit een dubbele verdedigingsmuur en kende allerlei torens op
nl|strategische plaatsen de binnenste stadsmuur werd gebouwd tussen en en had diverse torens in opgegraven
nl|restanten van een van deze torens hadden een muurdikte van circa meter de binnenste stadsmuur
nl|was van tufsteen gebouwd in plaats van het gebruikelijke baksteen later in de e eeuw
nl|werd aan de buitenkant van de bestaande muur op ongeveer meter afstand een tweede stadsmuur
nl|gebouwd van baksteen deze muur werd in opgeleverd en had onderaan een dikte van meter
nl|een van de torens die deel uitmaakte van de verdedigingswerken was de noordenbergtoren deze stond
nl|aan de noordwestkant van de stad en was gebouwd rond deze ronde toren was circa
nl|zestig meter hoog en de muren waren ongeveer zes meter dik als voorbeeld voor het
nl|ontwerp van de noordenbergtoren was de nog bestaande bourgonjetoren van het kasteel duurstede gebruikt oorspronkelijk
nl|stond de toren vlak buiten de stadsmuren maar door stadsuitbreidingen kwam de toren in de
nl|stad te staan waardoor hij de functie van vooruitgeschoven wachtpost verloor aan de andere kant
nl|van de stad nabij de bergkerk stond de steckelentoren niet lang voor het beleg van
nl|deventer was de stad nog door gelderse milities vanuit de veluwe aangevallen deze milities streden
nl|aan de zijde van de staten generaal en stonden onder leiding van wolter hegeman de
nl|stad kon deze aanvallen afslaan maar besloot hierop wel de verdedigingswerken te versterken bij de
nl|stad lag een paalbrug over de ijssel die in deels verloren was gegaan door een
nl|stuwende ijsmassa op de ijssel in combinatie met de druk van het water de stad
nl|had niet direct geld om de brug te herbouwen in schonk filips ii vijftig eikenbomen
nl|aan de stad waarmee de brug werd hersteld van de brug die aanlandde ter hoogte
nl|van de noordenbergtoren werd gezegd dat ze geen gelijke had die heures gelijcken niet en
nl|hadde in den lande sinds lag er al een brug bij deventer waardoor een groot
nl|deel van de handelswaar uit de nederlanden naar duitsland via deventer ging de brug bij
nl|deventer benadrukte de strategische ligging van de stad vanwege de handel met de andere hanzesteden
nl|waren ook de ijsselkade en de natuurlijke haven ontstaan rond de monding van de schipbeek
nl|in de ijssel belangrijk voor de stad deventer werd aan de west en zuidzijde geheel
nl|begrensd door deze waterstromen aan de andere zijden van de stad was een gracht buiten
nl|de stadsmuur gegraven die net zoals de torens en muren deel uitmaakte van de verdedigingslinie
nl|in de stadsmuren waren aan de kant van de ijssel en schipbeek vele poorten om
nl|zo de handelaren een goede toegang tot de stad te bieden de grotere poorten gaven
nl|verbinding met het achterland enkele bekende poorten waren noordenbergpoort noordwesten brinkpoort noorden bergpoort oosten en
nl|de zandpoort zuidwesten deze namen komen in een aantal huidige straatnamen nog terug de meeste
nl|poorten zijn begin e eeuw gesloopt ten behoeve van stadsuitbreiding de bergpoort is in de
nl|tuin van het rijksmuseum in amsterdam herbouwd deventer was al sinds toen de hertog van
nl|alva een waals garnizoen in deventer had laten plaatsen een garnizoensstad vanwege dit garnizoen werd
nl|de stad tijdens oranjes tweede invasie in niet door willem van den bergh aangevallen waar
nl|andere steden zoals kampen en zutphen wel werden belegerd de stad bleef in spaanse handen
nl|en ze werd dan ook niet belegerd en bestraft door de spanjaarden die tijdens don
nl|frederiks veldtocht een groot deel van overijssel heroverden don juan van oostenrijk werd in door
nl|filips ii als landvoogd naar de nederlanden gestuurd met als doel de opstand te onderdrukken
nl|zonder religieuze concessies te doen door zijn ingrijpen zouden orde en rust terug moeten keren
nl|don juan besloot de waalse troepen te vervangen door een duits garnizoen waarmee hij de
nl|stad beter dacht te kunnen beschermen tegen aanvallen van staatse troepen uit angst voor represailles
nl|van het garnizoen hield het deventer stadsbestuur zich in afzijdig bij het opstellen van de
nl|pacificatie van gent de algehele leiding van het duitse garnizoen lag bij haurincourt maar de
nl|belangrijkste man was augustyn ryck die de uitvoerende taak had hij gaf de bevelen en
nl|orders aan de bezettende macht door de bevolking van deventer werd hij als een tiran
nl|ervaren het garnizoen moest worden betaald door het stadsbestuur van deventer dat al snel noodmunten
nl|moest laten slaan om de soldaten te kunnen blijven betalen in de zomer van hadden
nl|de bezetters al gedreigd de stad in brand te steken als de betaling te laat
nl|zou plaatsvinden dit gebeurde uiteindelijk niet maar soldaten plunderden wel diverse woningen in eiste de
nl|garnizoensleiding gulden per week ze wilden ook de kerkschatten weghalen om ze te laten omsmelten
nl|zodat de troepen daarmee betaald konden worden de deventenaren konden deze plundering voorkomen het stadsbestuur
nl|besloot dat de kerkschatten niet door de kerkmeesters vervreemd mochten worden omdat ze door de
nl|voorouders geschonken waren aan de kerk om het garnizoen te kunnen blijven betalen werd al
nl|het stadszilverwerk opgeofferd op een zestal bekers na don juan had begin het eeuwig edict
nl|ondertekend waarmee hij de pacificatie van gent erkende dit betekende in principe een wapenstilstand tussen
nl|de spaanse en staatse troepen het eeuwig edict werd al in juli door hem geschonden
nl|toen hij de citadel van namen veroverde eind januari versloegen de spanjaarden staatse troepen tijdens
nl|de slag bij gembloers het gevoel van onveiligheid en de angst voor plunderingen werd in
nl|de gewesten holland en utrecht steeds groter daarom wilde men de verdrijving van de spaansgezinde
nl|troepen uit het noordoosten van de nederlanden jan van nassau drong hier in het bijzonder
nl|op aan tijdens een op juni gehouden vergadering in zutphen de staten generaal gaf uiteindelijk
nl|de stadhouder van overijssel graaf van rennenberg de opdracht om deventer te veroveren op de
nl|spaansgezinde troepen graaf van rennenberg was de opvolger van claudius van berlaymont die kort ervoor
nl|door de staten was ontslagen wegens zijn trouw aan filips ii twee maanden na de
nl|vergadering in zutphen op augustus kwam rennenberg aan bij de stad zijn leger bestond uit
nl|detachementen circa soldaten bestaande uit soldaten uit holland vijf vendels en friesland rennenberg had kampen
nl|de enig andere stad in overijssel die nog niet onder gezag van de staten generaal
nl|stond al veroverd op spaansgezinde troepen toen de garnizoensleiding de eerste tekenen van de komende
nl|belegering zag liet het de stadsbestuurders het besluit nemen dat alle personen die niet geschikt
nl|waren om arbeid te verrichten de stad moesten verlaten zodoende behoefden deze niet onderhouden te
nl|worden van in de stad aanwezige voorraden aan deze aanwijzing werd echter maar door weinigen
nl|gehoor gegeven omdat de mensen elders nog minder overlevingskansen zagen kerken en gildes gaven de
nl|armen geld zodat ze zich van de eerste levensbehoeften konden voorzien burgers die hielpen met
nl|de verdediging van de stad kregen van het duits garnizoen voedsel aangeboden bij de verdediging
nl|van de stad werden onder andere haakbussen gebruikt het leger van rennenberg was pas n
nl|dag bij deventer maar zorgde er op augustus meteen voor dat de molens die bij
nl|deventer stonden afbrandden ook liet rennenberg de ijssel afsluiten voor scheepvaartverkeer door de rivier te
nl|blokkeren met een aantal schepen waaronder een oorlogsschip deze blokkade was niet compleet zodat schepen
nl|zij het met groot gevaar toch nog van en naar de stad konden varen ook
nl|bezette het leger onder leiding van diederik sonoy de hoogten nabij de noordenbergpoort waarop de
nl|windmolens stonden vanaf hier kon hij de noordenbergpoort en de achterliggende stad beschieten vanaf de
nl|noordenbergtoren werden de stellingen van sonoy op hun beurt door het duitse garnizoen bestookt ter
nl|bescherming van zijn eigen troepen liet sonoy rondom de hoogten een wal aanleggen waardoor een
nl|aarden schans ontstond ook liet hij door boeren een loopgraaf graven naar de brinkpoort deze
nl|boeren waren door rennenberg gecontracteerd als pioniers die de schansen moesten graven omdat zijn soldaten
nl|enkel opdracht hadden om te vechten en eventueel verschansingen te versterken het opwerpen of graven
nl|van nieuwe verschansingen behoorde niet tot de taken van de soldaten door het laten graven
nl|van een loopgraaf probeerde sonoy dicht bij de stadsgracht te komen die hij vervolgens wilde
nl|laten dempen om dit uit te voeren moesten zijn troepen eerst de wachtposten op de
nl|noordenbergpoort en andere bolwerken aan deze kant van de stad uitschakelen de duitse verdedigers wilden
nl|voorkomen dat de boeren de gracht zouden bereiken en zij vielen de boeren aan hierbij
nl|vielen veel slachtoffers onder de boeren maar met een tegenaanval schoten staatse troepen hen te
nl|hulp ook de duitsers leden hierbij grote verliezen en moesten zich terugtrekken nadat de duitse
nl|troepen terug de stad ingedreven waren wilde sonoy de boeren weer aan het werk hebben
nl|vanwege het grote aantal slachtoffers door de duitse uitval weigerden zij dit gelderse troepen die
nl|wederom onder leiding stonden van hegeman beschoten de stad vanaf een bolwerk op de westoever
nl|van de ijssel de paalbrug van deventer werd door de geldersen op september in brand
nl|gestoken dit gebeurde meer uyt nijdt dan profijt de brug zou twee dagen hebben gebrand
nl|sonoy had een aanvalstactiek bedacht waarmee de staatse troepen de noordenbergpoort en de daar deel
nl|van uitmakende noordenbergtoren konden veroveren hij wilde dit bewerkstelligen door middel van het graven van
nl|tunnels die de belegeraars in de stad zouden brengen na verloop van tijd ontdekten de
nl|belegerden deze tactiek echter en zij begonnen met het graven van tunnels in tegengestelde richting
nl|op september was het zo ver dat beide partijen elkaar ondergronds tegenkwamen troepen uit de
nl|stad waren hierop voorbereid en zij bliezen giftige rook in de gangen bij de gevechten
nl|die hierop volgden werden de belegeraars verdreven de dagen erna vonden er weer gevechten plaats
nl|in de gangen en de aanvallers rukten daarbij steeds verder op in de richting van
nl|de stad de duitse verdedigers sloten uiteindelijk het gangenstelsel van hun kant af met een
nl|zwaar ijzeren hek de noordenbergtoren was door de beschietingen vanaf de schans van sonoy gaan
nl|wankelen waarna de top van de toren op september er vanaf viel de val van
nl|het dak maakte zoveel lawaai dat het van binnen waanen deed dat het gansche gebouw
nl|daar heen viel en hun een storm was naakende hierbij vielen echter geen gewonden overdag
nl|schoten de staatse troepen van hun gemaakte schans met kanonnen op de stad ze schoten
nl|echter maar tot kanonskogels per dag af die amper schade toebrachten aan de stad na
nl|verloop van tijd werd het aantal schoten wel verhoogd maar dit had weinig effect een
nl|aantal buiten de stad gelegen aanzienlijke gebouwen zoals het stift ter hunnepe aan de schipbeek
nl|het vrouwenklooster diepenveen en het hof te kolmenschate werden gedurende het beleg wel verwoest de
nl|druk op de stad werd in de loop der tijd alsmaar groter daarom besloot de
nl|garnizoensleiding op september een uitval te laten doen naar de schans van sonoy iets wat
nl|op en september ook al geprobeerd was de wachtposten en bewakers van de staatsen die
nl|ook s nachts patrouilleerden in verband met mogelijke uitvallen werden ditmaal verrast en gemakkelijk uitgeschakeld
nl|uiteindelijk konden de aanvallers zelfs in het kamp van sonoy doordringen en maakten wapens en
nl|proviand buit delen van het kamp werden in brand gestoken en soldaten die zich verzetten
nl|werden gedood daarnaast werden ook enkele krijgsgevangenen gemaakt een paar duitse soldaten raakten echter te
nl|ver uit de stad en zij werden opgepakt door staatse troepen een van die soldaten
nl|was ytelrijch van schoonauw die de rang van vaandrig had en een broer was van
nl|hans friedrick van schoonauw die van buitenaf moest zorgen voor een ontzet van de stad
nl|ytelrijch werd uitgehoord over de situatie in de stad daarnaast werd gebruikgemaakt van herauten boodschappers
nl|om de standpunten van de andere partij te horen de herauten die werkten voor rennenberg
nl|hadden ook opdracht om de burgerij op te zetten tegen het garnizoen de garnizoenssoldaten misdroegen
nl|zich vaak ze hadden de bevolking van de stad ontwapend door de misdragingen kwamen de
nl|burgers steeds meer in opstand tegen het duitse garnizoen om de bevolking in de hand
nl|te houden besloot de garnizoensleiding een overeenkomst met de deventenaren aan te gaan waarin ze
nl|beloofden zich van onrecht en wreedheden te zullen onthouden van de bevolking verlangde het garnizoen
nl|dat zij meehielp met het versterken van de verdedigingswerken op een bijeenkomst op het grote
nl|kerkhof bij de lebuinuskerk gaf de bevolking echter aan hier niet mee in te stemmen
nl|in de praktijk hielden de duitsers zich ook niet aan de overeenkomst zo vonden ze
nl|dat niet genoeg soldij gekregen en ze besloten daarom het goud en zilverwerk van de
nl|kerken in beslag te nemen dit edelmetaal waaronder drie zilveren schrijnen met relieken van lebuinus
nl|radboud en marcellinus werd in een plechtige optocht naar de deventer munt gebracht om er
nl|vierkante munten van te laten slaan ook braken de soldaten enkele houten huizen af om
nl|zich tijdens de koude dagen van brandhout te voorzien de garnizoensleiding herhaalde tijdens het beleg
nl|een aantal malen het bevel dat personen die geen kostwinner geestelijke of bestuurder waren de
nl|stad moesten verlaten hier werd wederom amper gehoor aan gegeven door de bevolking begin november
nl|werd er door het bestuur van de bergkerk en twee gilden in totaal goudgulden circa
nl|stuivers uitgedeeld aan de armen onder de bevolking graaf van rennenberg had zijn eigen zorgen
nl|de hollandse troepen van zijn leger werden teruggeroepen door het gewest holland rennenberg was hier
nl|heel ontstemd over en besloot daarom het garnizoen dat in kampen gelegerd was naar deventer
nl|te roepen het gewest holland was hier niet blij mee en wendde zich tot willem
nl|van oranje deze had echter voldoende vertrouwen in rennenberg waarna het garnizoen naar deventer kon
nl|vertrekken dit garnizoen bestaande uit circa franse soldaten onder leiding van antonis van glimes arriveerde
nl|ongeveer op het moment dat de hollandse vendels vertrokken johan van den kornput kwam rennenberg
nl|van adviezen voorzien van den kornput had onder andere geholpen bij de verdediging van aalst
nl|het eerste advies om de bergpoort aan te vallen ondervond veel weerstand bij andere officieren
nl|en werd daarom niet uitgevoerd intussen bleven de beschietingen van deventer doorgaan vooral op de
nl|zandpoort andere adviezen van van den kornput werden w l overgenomen door de legerleiding van
nl|rennenberg zo werden diverse schansen en torens rondom de stad gebouwd zodat het gehele gebied
nl|goed te overzien was door de staatse troepen nu kon de stad niet meer worden
nl|voorzien van nieuwe munitie en proviand van buitenaf het was voor het eerst sinds het
nl|beleg van alesia in de romeinse tijd dat een soort circumvallatielinie aangelegd werd van den
nl|kornput noemde dit dan ook een nieuw maniere van schantzen daarnaast adviseerde hij het grachtwater
nl|om te leiden hetgeen ook uitgevoerd werd het lukte ook om gangen te graven waarmee
nl|de bolwerken van de stad ondermijnd werden een derde uitgevoerd advies was om de stad
nl|vooral vanaf de westoever van de ijssel te bestoken met kanonnen het duitse garnizoen in
nl|de stad deventer weigerde lange tijd zich over te geven ook nadat het tweemaal achter
nl|elkaar slecht nieuws te horen kreeg een eerste maal was toen het bericht de stad
nl|bereikte dat don juan van oostenrijk op oktober overleden was een tweede maal was toen
nl|de stad te horen kreeg dat de kans op ontzet door een duits leger onder
nl|leiding van hans friedrich van schoonauw verkeken was omdat dit leger nabij bottrop verslagen was
nl|de laatste hoop van de belegerden was het leger van johan stuper dat de stad
nl|zou kunnen ontzetten na verloop van tijd bleek dit leger omgekeerd te zijn en de
nl|rijn te hebben overgestoken de voorraden voedsel en munitie in de stad raakten op de
nl|garnizoensleiding besloot daarom om tot onderhandeling met rennenberg over te gaan na vijf dagen onderhandelen
nl|werd een verdrag getekend waarbij de stad zich overgaf aan de staatse troepen het garnizoen
nl|nog man sterk mocht de stad deventer met have en goed en opgerolde vaandels verlaten
nl|eerder waren al krijgsgevangenen uitgewisseld de soldaten werden begeleid tot de duitse grens nabij bocholt
nl|en er werd overeengekomen dat ze gedurende drie maanden niet actief in de republiek zouden
nl|zijn om hun spullen te vervoeren werden wagens uitgeleend door de staatse troepen ondertussen trokken
nl|staatse troepen de stad in onder leiding van gelderse vendels waar onder meer honderd ruiters
nl|deel van uitmaakten aan de waalse troepen die deel uitmaakten van rennenbergs leger werd door
nl|rennenberg snel hun achterstallige soldij betaald waarna ze naar huis werden gestuurd zo werd het
nl|gevaar van plundering door deze troepen voorkomen de belegering van deventer had de staten generaal
nl|veel geld gekost aan loonkosten was het al gulden kwijt en aan munitie en materiaalkosten
nl|nog eens gulden omgerekend naar de koopkracht van is het gelijk aan euro loonkosten en
nl|euro munitie en materiaalkosten ter gelegenheid van de inname van de stad werden door de
nl|deventer munt speciale munten geslagen met de opdruk godt heft die stadt deventer getroest und
nl|den november verloest ick voede min jongen met min bloet bis ik vertere min lif
nl|en goedt de tweede regel staat op de achterzijde in deventer werd na de inname
nl|door staatse troepen een religievrede afgekondigd waardoor zowel katholieken als gereformeerden hun geloof vrij konden
nl|uitoefenen in sommige kerken werden na de inname zowel katholieke als calvinistische diensten gehouden na
nl|de inname van deventer verdeelde rennenberg zijn troepen over verschillende steden waarover hij landvoogd was
nl|met uitzondering van de gelderse vendels die in deventer achterbleven en een vendel dat naar
nl|zeeland werd gestuurd rennenberg zelf reisde naar antwerpen in antwerpen kreeg hij bericht dat de
nl|gelderse troepen zich misdroegen daarom kreeg hij het verzoek van het stadsbestuur om de troepen
nl|uit de stad terug te trekken aan de stad werd beloofd dat de gelderse troepen
nl|niet lang zouden blijven maar dat deze snel terug konden keren wanneer de bestuurders dat
nl|nodig achtten nadat het stadsbestuur een garnizoen had samengesteld uit de eigen bevolking vertrok uiteindelijk
nl|op februari het gelderse garnizoen uit deventer het deventer garnizoen bestond nu uit acht vendels
nl|die onder leiding stonden van meenslieden leden van de gezworen gemeente die zichzelf hadden benoemd
nl|tot officier in was de angst in de stad groot dat spaansgezinde troepen de stad
nl|zouden willen heroveren op aandringen van de meenslieden werd de stadsmuur op de zwakke punten
nl|versterkt daarnaast werden mensen die van buiten de stad kwamen zeer wantrouwend bekeken om er
nl|zeker van te zijn dat hier geen mensen tussen zaten die voor de spanjaarden werkten
nl|werd nieuwvestigers verplicht zich eerst te melden bij de burgemeesters herbergiers dienden aan de magistraten
nl|door te geven aan welke gasten ze onderdak boden om de eigen bevolking in de
nl|hand te houden stelde het stadsbestuur op december weer de doodstraf in op het dienst
nl|nemen bij een vijandig leger door onder meer de belegering in viel de handel in
nl|deventer grotendeels stil de meeste jaarmarkten de momenten waar de meeste goederen werden verhandeld gingen
nl|tot niet door deventer probeerde de handel wel weer op te pakken na het beleg
nl|maar amsterdam had de functie van stapelplaats van deventer grotendeels overgenomen daarnaast was de voornaamste
nl|handelsroute van holland naar duitsland verlegd van deventer naar zwolle ten slotte werd de handel
nl|van boter en kaas in de hollandse steden zelf opgezet waar ook diverse waaggebouwen werden
nl|gebouwd de belegering en het verdwijnen van de handel zorgde er ook voor dat het
nl|inwonertal in deventer flink daalde in woonden er nog tot mensen in de stad maar
nl|na de belegering en opvolgende tegenspoed daalde het inwoneraantal naar circa personen de situatie in
nl|het noorden van de nederlanden veranderde in de jaren na het beleg de katholieke graaf
nl|van rennenberg liep op maart over van de staatse naar de spaanse zijde hij probeerde
nl|met opruiende brieven de steden in overijssel waaronder deventer naar zijn kant over te halen
nl|als reactie daarop werden in deventer religieuze beelden van de lebuinuskerk en de bergkerk evenals
nl|in de kloosters en gasthuizen vernield in het zuiden was de hertog van parma alexander
nl|farnese begonnen met een opmars alexander farnese was de opvolger van don juan van oostenrijk
nl|hij veroverde een groot aantal steden en samen met het gebied van rennenberg die steden
nl|vanuit het noorden aanviel had hij al snel een groot deel van de nederlanden in
nl|handen deventer viel uiteindelijk door verraad van de engelse officieren william stanley en rowland york
nl|die de militaire leiding hadden in de stad in weer in spaanse handen in keerden
nl|de kansen weer doordat het slecht ging in spanje zelf en een groot deel van
nl|het spaanse leger inclusief alexander farnese door filips ii naar frankrijk werd gestuurd om tegen
nl|hendrik iv van frankrijk in de hugenotenoorlog te vechten prins maurits maakte hier gebruik van
nl|en in de tien jaren die volgden veroverde hij een groot aantal steden in het
nl|jaar heroverde maurits de stad deventer weer op de spanjaarden tijdens het tweede beleg van
nl|deventer de dertien jaar tussen de belegeringen van en werden in deventer ook wel de
nl|quade jaren genoemd sporen uit de tijd van het beleg van zijn in deventer schaars
nl|zo is de noordenbergtoren in afgebroken nadat het gebouw zijn functie had verloren en het
nl|niet meer werd gebruikt als opslagplaats voor kruit de stadsmuren voldeden in de e eeuw
nl|niet meer als verdedigingswerken waarna ze werden vervangen door aarden wallen die werden aangelegd volgens
nl|het oud nederlands vestingstelsel in deventer betekende dat in de periode tot grote delen van
nl|de stadsmuren en bijbehorende torens werden afgebroken aan de zijde van de ijssel en de
nl|schipbeek bleven de muren nog wel staan tussen deze muren werden in die tijd kleine
nl|huizen gebouwd straten in het centrum van deventer die in de naam achter de muren
nl|hebben zoals achter de muren zandpoort danken hun naam aan deze ontwikkelingen de natuurlijke haven
nl|die ontstond door de monding van de schipbeek in de ijssel is grotendeels in de
nl|jaren van de e eeuw gedempt ten bate van de wilhelminabrug het laatste gedeelte van
nl|de oude haven is in gedempt de loop van de schipbeek was daarvoor al aangepast
nl|waardoor de beek ten zuiden van deventer al in de ijssel uitmondt andere sporen uit
nl|de tijd van het beleg zijn in deventer ook te vinden zo is in een
nl|parkeergarage aan de gibsonstraat de fundering te bezichtigen van de noordenbergtoren die daar in werd
nl|blootgelegd in het plaveisel van de straat zijn de afmetingen van de toren uitgezet aan
nl|de walstraat zijn in tijdens de realisatie van een doorbraak om het centrum met het
nl|boreelterrein te verbinden restanten gevonden van de binnen en buitenmuur van de stad ook ter
nl|hoogte van de sijzenbaan zijn in restanten gevonden van de buitenste stadsmuur inclusief toren een
nl|klein gebied op de westoever van de ijssel wordt vanouds het bolwerk genoemd de namen

nl|pheasant elzas ardennen colmar nutcracker blackcock grenade veritable lumberjack plunder de slag om de ardennen
nl|ook wel ardennenoffensief was het laatste grote offensief van de duitse wehrmacht aan het westfront
nl|in de tweede wereldoorlog de slag vond plaats in de ardennen van december tot januari
nl|en werd gewonnen door de geallieerden in de engelstalige wereld staat deze strijd bekend onder
nl|de naam battle of the bulge omdat de frontlijn de vorm had van een uitstulping
nl|of zak a in de zomer van had duitsland zware nederlagen geleden waarin een belangrijk
nl|deel van het duitse leger vernietigd was daarna waren de fronten echter tijdelijk gestabiliseerd zodat
nl|weer een pantserreserve kon worden opgebouwd adolf hitler wilde nu die tanks met zijn laatste
nl|reserves aan manschappen inzetten voor een groot tegenoffensief waarmee hij de strijd alsnog in zijn
nl|voordeel hoopte te beslechten zo n beslissing kon alleen in het westen vallen want aan
nl|het oostfront zou de diepte van de sovjet unie iedere aanval moeiteloos opvangen in het
nl|westen leek het echter mogelijk antwerpen te heroveren de enige grote haven waarmee de geallieerden
nl|voorraden konden aanvoeren twee pantserlegers met veel eenheden van de waffen ss moesten binnen zes
nl|dagen bij verrassing door de zwak met amerikaanse troepen bezette ardennen heenbreken de maas overschrijden
nl|en antwerpen bereiken daarmee zou meteen het britse leger omsingeld worden zodat het kon worden
nl|vernietigd een wellicht fatale slag voor de oorlogsinspanning van de westelijke geallieerden op december ging
nl|het offensief van start slecht weer bood de duitse troepen dekking tegen de oppermachtige geallieerde
nl|luchtmacht het maakte echter ook de wegen van de ardennen vrijwel onbegaanbaar het noordelijke e
nl|pantserleger wist wel door te breken en een dertigtal kilometers op te rukken maar slaagde
nl|er niet in het doorbraakpunt naar het noorden te verbreden doordat de amerikaanse troepen op
nl|de heuvelrug van elsenborn standhielden uiteindelijk liep men hierdoor vast en kon men luik waar
nl|de maas moest worden overgestoken niet bereiken zuidelijker had het e pantserleger meer succes de
nl|doorbraak sloeg een breed gat in het amerikaanse front en de duitsers bleven een week
nl|naar het westen oprukken bijna ten oosten van dinant de maas bereikend op dat moment
nl|was de amerikaanse e luchtlandingsdivisie echter al naar het wegenknooppunt bastenaken gereden en had dit
nl|sterk ter verdediging ingericht de omsingelde amerikanen verdedigden het stadje tegen alle aanvallen en verstoorden
nl|daarmee de duitse aanvoer bij gebrek aan brandstof en munitie moesten de duitse tanks op
nl|december bij celles hun opmars staken de amerikaanse bevelvoering in het noorden van de ardennen
nl|was in het ongerede geraakt de britse veldmaarschalk bernard montgomery nam daar het bevel over
nl|bouwde een hecht front op en posteerde britse troepen dwars op de duitse opmarsroute bij
nl|dinant tegelijkertijd kwam de amerikaanse generaal george patton uit het zuiden te hulp met het
nl|e leger en ontzette bastenaken het weer werd zonniger en jachtbommenwerpers teisterden de duitse troepen
nl|uit alle fronten toestromende amerikaanse pantserdivisies schiepen een grote geallieerde overmacht aan tanks hitler wilde
nl|echter niet toegeven dat het offensief mislukt was en beval alsnog bastenaken te nemen na
nl|zware strijd mislukte dat montgomery viel de duitse aanvalswig uit het noorden aan en patton
nl|uit het zuiden hitler stond nu toe de ardennen te ontruimen en rond januari waren
nl|de duitsers weer terug op hun beginposities het offensief leidde tot spanningen tussen de britten
nl|en de amerikanen de geplande geallieerde aanvallen op het rijnland werden zes weken uitgesteld zowel
nl|duitsers als amerikanen leden forse verliezen aan tanks en manschappen de amerikanen hadden echter vrijwel
nl|onuitputtelijke materieelreserves de duitsers daarentegen hadden nu geen pantserreserve meer om het grote offensief van
nl|het rode leger op te vangen dat op januari aan de weichsel losbarstte eind januari
nl|stonden de sovjetlegers voor berlijn het ardennenoffensief was een persoonlijk plan van adolf hitler om
nl|aan het westelijke front de meest noordelijke troepen van de geallieerden af te snijden van
nl|hun bevoorradingslijnen en ze daarna te vernietigen al sinds de zomermaanden van toen duitsland catastrofale
nl|nederlagen leed in normandi en wit rusland liep hij rond met de gedachte om nog
nl|n keer over te gaan tot een groot succesvol offensief een militaire overwinning achtte hij
nl|noodzakelijk om de hoop op een eindoverwinning levend te houden en de geallieerden die sinds
nl|begin een onvoorwaardelijke overgave eisten tot onderhandelingen over het be indigen van de oorlog te
nl|dwingen begin september hadden de geallieerden door een snelle opmars antwerpen bevrijd wat hen voor
nl|het eerst een grote haven verschafte om zich te bevoorraden al op september beval hitler
nl|een grote tegenaanval voor te bereiden om antwerpen te heroveren op september overlegde hitler voor
nl|het eerst met zijn militaire staf over de concrete opties nadat hitler van gerd von
nl|rundstedt de situatie in het westen had doorgekregen besloot hij om op september dieper op
nl|zijn plannen in te gaan de situatie aan het oostfront leek geen kans op beslissend
nl|succes te bieden voor een inzet van grote reserves in het westen daarentegen waren er
nl|wel degelijk mogelijkheden omdat het aantal geallieerde divisies er veel lager lag en ze een
nl|beperkte strategische diepte hadden om zich terug te trekken er zijn verschillende redenen waarom hitler
nl|de ardennen koos als operatiegebied waarschijnlijk was het feit dat hij daar in mei zijn
nl|eerste opzienbarende succes aan het westfront had geboekt er een van toen had hij een
nl|gewaagd plan fall gelb later wel de sichelschnitt genaamd goedgekeurd waarvan de succesvolle uitvoering tevoren
nl|onmogelijk had geleken achteraf raakte hitler ervan overtuigd dat hij het plan zelf had bedacht
nl|in plaats van een van zijn beste strategen erich von manstein de situatie en de
nl|krachtsverhoudingen waren toen echter geheel anders dan in in kon hij de helft van zijn
nl|leger op dit gebied concentreren in moest hij op vele fronten tegelijkertijd oorlogvoeren in beheerste
nl|de luftwaffe het luchtruim maar nu de geallieerden slecht weer kon daartegen dekking bieden maar
nl|zou ook het slechte wegennet van de ardennen bijna ondoordringbaar maken tijdens fall gelb hadden
nl|de belgen en fransen de ardennen meteen ontruimd nu lag er een front dat doorbroken
nl|moest worden hitler wilde echter het gegeven uitbuiten dat de geallieerden in het noorden een
nl|sterkere aanvalsvleugel hadden terwijl hun zuidelijke vleugel in de sector van de ardennen slechts matig
nl|bezet was door de vernietiging van twintig dertig geallieerde divisies van de in totaal divisies
nl|aan het westfront zou de strijd in het westen in n keer in het voordeel
nl|van duitsland moeten worden beslist daarvoor wilde hij zelf divisies uittrekken de operatie zou pas
nl|een succes genoemd kunnen worden als de overige stellingen aan het westfront met inbegrip van
nl|die in nederland gehouden konden worden en de westerschelde kon worden afgesloten daarbij moest de
nl|situatie aan het oostfront stabiel zijn zodat daar geen beroep op de krachten van de
nl|strategische reserve hoefde te worden gedaan er moest zekerheid bestaan dat de reserves aan manschappen
nl|voor de duur van de operatie voor het westfront beschikbaar waren het belangrijkste was echter
nl|dat de voorste gevechtseenheden de tegenstander aan het front snel zouden verslaan zodat de vijand
nl|geen tijd zou hebben het offensief met reserves te stuiten dat zou kunnen als de
nl|aanvalswig een betrekkelijk geringe afstand hoefde af te leggen voordat het hoofddoel bereikt was op
nl|oktober legde alfred jodl nog n keer alle aanvalsmogelijkheden naast elkaar de verschillende mogelijkheden werden
nl|gepresenteerd als vijf operatieplannen i operatie nederland deze optie behelsde een frontale aanval om het
nl|britse leger te verpletteren de aanval zou vanuit de sector venlo in westelijke richting in
nl|de richting van antwerpen worden ondernomen ii operatie luik aken deze aanval had het oprollen
nl|van een lang stuk van het amerikaanse front ten doel een hoofdaanval zou uit de
nl|noordelijke punt van luxemburg naar het noordwesten worden gericht de aanval moest daarna naar het
nl|noorden zwenken om dan samen te vallen met een in die richting ondernomen nevenaanval vanuit
nl|het gebied ten noordwesten van aken iii operatie luxemburg hiervan was het doel de vernietiging
nl|van het amerikaanse derde leger twee aanvalsspitsen uit het midden van luxemburg en de sector
nl|metz zouden in de sector longwy bijeenkomen en het gebied van minette bezetten iv operatie
nl|lotharingen twee aanvalsvleugels moesten oprukken vanuit metz en baccarat plaatsen die ten westen van de
nl|vogezen liggen met het doel bij nancy samen te komen v operatie elzas twee aanvallen
nl|vanuit het gebied ten oosten van pinal en montb liard met het doel nabij vesoul
nl|samen te komen nadat de militaire staf de voor en nadelen van de verschillende operatieplannen
nl|tegen elkaar had afgewogen kwam de nadruk steeds meer te liggen op de varianten en
nl|een doorbraak door de ardennen zou gecombineerd worden met een opmars naar antwerpen op oktober
nl|gaf hitler de stafchefs van het oberbefehl west en van de heeresgruppe b siegfried westphal
nl|en hans krebs de mogelijkheid om naar het plan te komen kijken en zich er
nl|vertrouwd mee te maken hij maakte de generaals het plan duidelijk en verklaarde dat duitsland
nl|met het oog op de oorlogssituatie eindelijk eens een offensief moest beginnen het moest eens
nl|afgelopen zijn met dat eeuwige verdedigen het offensief zou uit twee fasen bestaan in de
nl|eerste fase kwam het erop aan de maas te bereiken en een bruggenhoofd te vormen
nl|deze fase moest op de vierde dag voltooid zijn in de tweede fase moest de
nl|stad antwerpen worden genomen op de zesde dag het doel van de operatie was de
nl|geallieerde strijdkrachten ten noorden van de lijn bastenaken brussel antwerpen af te snijden en te
nl|vernietigen minstens zo belangrijk was de uitschakeling van de haven van antwerpen want die haven
nl|gold als belangrijke aanvoerhaven voor de geallieerde troepen na alle aanvalsplannen te hebben doorgenomen noemde
nl|hitler november als dag van de aanval in het hoofdkwartier van de heeresgruppe b en
nl|bij het oberbefehl west maakten von rundstedt en model onmiddellijk hun bezwaren tegen de opzet
nl|van de operatie kenbaar zij kwamen daarom met alternatieve voorstellen op oktober besprak von rundstedt
nl|de plannen van de operatie met zijn medewerkers ook zij kwamen tot de conclusie dat
nl|het offensief te hoog gegrepen was von rundstedt ging zijn eigen plan ontwerpen zoals dat
nl|door het oberkommando der wehrmacht okw was bevolen het kreeg de codenaam martin volgens dit
nl|plan zouden twee pantserlegers over een frontbreedte van veertig kilometer tussen simmerath ten noordoosten van
nl|monschau en bleialf tot aan de maas doorstoten zowel in het noorden als in het
nl|zuiden zou een leger de flanken dekken een tweede aanvalsgroep moest ten zuidwesten van roermond
nl|langs de stad trekken om zich bij luik bij de vleugel te voegen in tegenstelling
nl|tot von rundstedt verwierp model een tweede aanval zijn voorstel herbstnebel was om met twee
nl|pantserlegers over een breedte van zestig kilometer tussen h rtgenwald en l tzkampen door te
nl|stoten naar de maas eind oktober kwamen beide bevelhebbers echter tot een compromis en konden
nl|ze het plan martin met een beperkte doelstelling voltooien ze besloten een aanval te lanceren
nl|vanuit twee punten de eerste aanval zou vanuit de eifel worden ingezet en de tweede
nl|zou plaatsvinden in de sector roermond dit zou de amerikaanse strijdkrachten vernietigen die het rijnland
nl|dreigden binnen te dringen beide opperbevelhebbers waren van oordeel dat hitlers plan gezien de beschikbare
nl|krachten te verreikend was het okw hield echter nog steeds vast aan de ambitieuze doelstelling
nl|zoals deze door hitler was opgesteld model en von rundstedt probeerden de gehele maand november
nl|hitler en jodl ervan te overtuigen dat het zinvoller was om eerst met kleinere operaties
nl|te beginnen waarop de grote operatie dan later kon aansluiten hitler gaf echter niet toe
nl|aan zijn generaals en liet de volgende aantekeningen maken inmiddels was het laatste duitse bruggenhoofd
nl|ten westen van de maas bij venlo grotendeels door de geallieerden ingenomen met operatie nutcracker
nl|had het britse leger vanaf november de linkeroever van de maas in noord limburg in
nl|een tangbeweging schoongeveegd blerick werd als laatste op december bevrijd model deed op december nog
nl|een laatste poging hitler om te praten maar het mocht niet baten al wees model
nl|nog zo op de wanverhouding tussen sterkte en doelstelling waarbij hij vooral de nadruk legde
nl|op de geallieerde overmacht in de lucht hitler bleef bij zijn besluit daarmee was het
nl|uiteindelijke besluit ten gunste van de grote doelstelling gevallen op en december liet hitler zijn
nl|generaals en divisiecommandanten van de heeresgruppeÂ b in zijn hoofdkwartier nabij bad nauheim bijeenkomen hij
nl|wilde hun mededelen dat zijn besluit onveranderd bleef en de grote doelstelling werd nagestreefd hij
nl|motiveerde zijn beslissing op politieke en militaire gronden of hij zijn gasten kon overtuigen is
nl|onduidelijk op november had de chef van de wehrmachtf hrungsstab de stafchef van het oberbefehl
nl|west de eerste marsorder toegezonden de grote doelstelling van unternehmen wacht am rhein was de
nl|tegenstander ten noorden van de lijn bastenaken brussel antwerpen te vernietigen het was de taak
nl|van de heeresgruppe b om met drie legers door het geallieerde front te breken en
nl|enkele strategische plaatsen te bezetten van daaruit kon men dan de aanval op de afgesneden
nl|divisies inzetten om dit te bereiken moest het zesde pantserleger aan weerszijden van luik de
nl|bruggen over de maas ongeschonden in handen krijgen daarnaast moest in noordelijke richting een sterk
nl|afweerfront worden gebouwd waarna men moest doorstoten naar het albertkanaal dat moest tussen maastricht en
nl|antwerpen in duitse handen vallen en de sector ten noorden van antwerpen moest eveneens worden
nl|veroverd tegelijkertijd moest het e pantserleger de maas tussen fumay en namen oversteken en op
nl|de lijn antwerpen brussel namen dinant verhinderen dat geallieerde reserves vanuit het westen het de
nl|achterhoede van het e pantserleger lastig zouden maken het e leger moest de zuidelijke en
nl|zuidwestelijke flank dekken met als taak de maas en de semois te bereiken bovendien moest
nl|het ten oosten van luxemburg aansluiting zoeken met het moezelfront de doorbraak van heeresgruppe b
nl|moest in een opvolgende fase door heeresgruppe student worden uitgebuit zodra de omsingelde vijandelijke troepen
nl|in een verwachte poging naar het zuiden uit te breken sterkere eenheden begonnen in te
nl|zetten tegen de afsluiting tussen de roer en maas of tegen het albertkanaal dat zou
nl|de frontlinies in nederland verzwakken die dan van het noorden uit konden worden doorbroken in
nl|september waren de systematische voorbereidingen voor het offensief al begonnen om de legereenheden die tot
nl|de aanval moesten overgaan moed in te blazen kregen de divisies een volledig nieuwe uitrusting
nl|de troepen werden getraind op het uitvoeren van tegenaanvallen en gevechten in de nacht eind
nl|oktober beval het okw om grote brandstofreserves aan te leggen zodat er voldoende brandstof zou
nl|zijn tijdens het offensief dit alles verliep bepaald niet vlekkeloos aangezien naast de voorbereidingen op
nl|het offensief ook strijd aan het westfront werd geleverd de eenheden waren vaak gedecimeerd en
nl|de gevechtswaarde ervan was verminderd midden september leek de gedachte aan een tegenoffensief nog onzinnig
nl|het duitse westelijk front was in elkaar gestort en de restanten ervan vluchtten naar de
nl|duitse grens het mislukken van de luchtlandingsoperaties in operatie market garden waaronder de slag om
nl|arnhem die een snelle overgang over de rijn hadden willen afdwingen gaf de duitsers echter
nl|de tijd een nieuw gesloten front te vormen het daarnaast nog opbouwen van een grote
nl|reserve bleek erg lastig men wist geen vijfenveertig divisies te verzamelen zoals hitler gewenst had
nl|maar slechts zevenentwintig ook dat kon alleen maar door de normale opleidingsduur van nieuwe rekruten
nl|drastisch in te korten groepen tieners werden gemengd met een klein aantal veteranen om zogenaamde
nl|volksgrenadierdivisies op te richten die hadden niet meer de tactische superioriteit die veel duitse eenheden
nl|tot dan toe ten opzichte van geallieerde divisies bezeten hadden een beslissend nadeel was verder
nl|dat de duitse eenheden een groot tekort hadden aan vrachtwagens terwijl de divisies van de
nl|westelijke geallieerden alle volledig waren gemotoriseerd de logistieke ondersteuning schoot ernstig tekort de munitieaanvoer was
nl|matig de rantsoenen karig en de brandstofvoorziening minimaal men mocht slechts hopen antwerpen te bereiken
nl|als onderweg steeds de grote geallieerde brandstofdepots in duitse handen zouden vallen omdat de infanterie
nl|zwak was zouden de pantsertroepen een beslissende rol moeten spelen op september waren er nog
nl|maar zo n driehonderd duitse tanks aanwezig aan het hele westfront in de zomer van
nl|piekte de tankproductie echter en hoewel de geallieerde bombardementen de fabricage uiteindelijk sterk zouden doen
nl|verminderen was het door een uitloop van het leveringsproces toch mogelijk de eenheden weer aardig
nl|op sterkte te krijgen op december was het aantal tanks in het westen weer opgelopen
nl|tot ruim een kwart daarvan was door mechanische gebreken niet direct inzetbaar daarbij konden niet
nl|alle tanks bij het ardennenoffensief worden ingezet want de andere frontsectoren hadden een minimale pantserreserve
nl|nodig in de eerste dagen werden zeven pantserdivisies in de strijd geworpen samen met wat
nl|kleinere verbanden telden die tanks iedere afzonderlijke divisie was dus niet al te groot in
nl|deze fase van de oorlog telden duitse pantserdivisies nog maar n pantserregiment met twee tankbataljons
nl|in mei rukten door de ardennen ook zeven van zulke divisies op maar die hadden
nl|toen vijftienhonderd tanks de sterkste divisie was nu de ss panzer division leibstandarte adolf hitler
nl|die tanks telde omdat ze versterkt was met de ss panzerabteilung uitgerust met vijfenveertig tiger
nl|iis nog eens twee nveertig van die zware tanks bevonden zich in de onafhankelijke schwere
nl|heerespanzerabteilung de amerikaanse troepen beschikten in de aangevallen sectoren over tanks en waren dus iets
nl|in de minderheid dat zou echter niet lang duren de amerikanen lieten snel pantserreserves aanrukken
nl|in de vorm van zeven van hun eigen pantserdivisies dat waren grote eenheden de nd
nl|en rd armoured division hadden ieder in beginsel middelzware tanks en de overige begin januari
nl|was de geallieerde tanksterkte in de slag opgelopen tot zo n voertuigen dat de duitsers
nl|toch een kans meenden te hebben kwam doordat hun tanks gemiddeld een stuk beter gepantserd
nl|en bewapend waren dan de geallieerde standaardtank de m sherman die hoge pantsering leidde wel
nl|tot extra gewicht wat niet zo gunstig was in het modderige terrein omdat de normale
nl|sherman niet zo goed bewapend was zetten de geallieerden grote hoeveelheden tankjagers in licht bepantserde
nl|rupsvoertuigen met een sterk kanon eerst meer nog dan echte tanks iedere amerikaanse infanteriedivisie had
nl|een organiek tankbataljon en twee bataljons tankjagers en daarmee meer voertuigen met een zwaar vlakbaangeschut
nl|dan een duitse panzerdivision in feite bezat ook de duitsers hadden echter van zulke tankjagers
nl|alsmede grote aantallen gemechaniseerd geschut voornamelijk het sturmgesch tz iii ook daarvan zou gedurende de
nl|hele slag de sterkte die van de eigenlijke tanks overtreffen sinds november speelden tevens de
nl|strikte geheimhouding en verscheidene misleidingsmaatregelen een bijzondere rol men liet bevelen uitgaan die alleen dienden
nl|om de tegenstander in verwarring te brengen door middel van valse seinen en beschildering van
nl|onderkomens werd de opmars van een in feite niet bestaand e leger naar de sector
nl|m nchengladbach keulen d sseldorf aan de geallieerden gesuggereerd daarnaast werden maatregelen getroffen om het
nl|voorgenomen offensief voor de tegenstander verborgen te houden troepen mochten zich alleen s nachts verplaatsen
nl|overdag werden de tanks in schuren en dichte bossen verscholen slechts een kleine groep officieren
nl|was bekend met de plannen pas half november werden de commandanten te velde ingelicht over
nl|het aanstaande offensief begin december volgden de divisiekaders terwijl de regiments en bataljonskaders pas op
nl|december werden ingelicht het is duidelijk dat de geheimhouding een van de voorwaarden was voor
nl|het succes van het hele offensief groot nadeel van deze geheimhouding terreinverkenning van de aanstaande
nl|slag was onmogelijk men had tot op de dag van de aanval geen idee van
nl|de gesteldheid van het terrein op december stonden de legers die aan het offensief zouden
nl|deelnemen in hun geheel paraat klaar om de aanval te openen de geheimhouding werkte vrijwel
nl|perfect slecht weer verhinderde een effectieve geallieerde luchtverkenning men had geen besef van een op
nl|handen zijnde aanval sommige commandanten verwachtten wel een wat groter duits tegenoffensief maar dan aan
nl|de roer nadat hitler begin december het offensief had vastgesteld op december werd het nog
nl|tot tweemaal toe uitgesteld eerst tot december en vervolgens tot december een dag voor het
nl|offensief zou starten liet hitler nog een bevel uitgaan naar model om hem met nadruk
nl|te verplichten alle van de opperste leiding komende bevelen onvoorwaardelijk uit te voeren en de
nl|gehoorzaamheid tot aan de laagste eenheid af te dwingen bron hitler verbood de pantsertroepen aan
nl|de oostzijde van de maas af te slaan naar het noorden direct in de rug
nl|van de noordelijker amerikaanse fronttroepen elke opeenhoping van de pantsereenheden in de sector luik moest
nl|worden voorkomen om de opmars naar antwerpen niet te vertragen als alle troepen de vastgestelde
nl|regels zouden naleven zou de operatie een groot succes moeten worden in een telegram vaardigde
nl|von rundstedt in de vroege morgen van december een dagorder uit aan de soldaten van
nl|het westfront waarin hij hen wees op het grote moment in het telegram stond het
nl|volgende draagt in u de heilige plicht alles te geven en het bovenmenselijke tot stand
nl|te brengen voor ons vaderland en onze f hrer oorspronkelijk zou de aanval fall weihnachtsrose
nl|heten later liet adolf hitler de naam wijzigen in unternehmen wacht am rhein de oorspronkelijke
nl|naam was gebaseerd op het feit dat de aanval rond kerst zou plaatsvinden de nieuwe
nl|naam was bedoeld als misleiding omdat een defensieve opstelling gesuggereerd werd de naam zou na
nl|de oorlog niet populair worden en is zelden gebruikt om het offensief aan te duiden
nl|ook omdat hitler twee dagen voor het offensief kwam met nog een nieuwe aanduiding herbstnebel
nl|al tijdens de eindfase van de strijd kwam de westerse pers met de aanduiding battle
nl|of the bulge dat verwees dan naar de saillant of frontboog die als een uitstulping
nl|werd gezien in duitsland sprak men na de oorlog van ardennenoffensive en in nederlands nam
nl|men dit over als ardennenoffensief in het frans werd het la bataille des ardennes de
nl|slag om de ardennen op december brak rond een half uur durend spervuur van tweeduizend
nl|duitse kanonnen los op de amerikaanse stellingen tussen monschau en echternach v s op weg
nl|naar luik en antwerpen trokken tegelijkertijd ronkend een vurig spoor door de donkere lucht het
nl|e pantserleger viel om aan het laatste grote duitse offensief van de tweede wereldoorlog was
nl|begonnen door de dichte mist rukten veertien duitse divisies vanuit de bossen van de sneeuweifel
nl|op naar de spaarzaam bemande amerikaanse linies tussen monschau en echternach omar bradley bevelhebber van
nl|de e legergroep beschikte op dat moment over divisies aan de duitse westgrens zestien van
nl|deze divisies lagen ten noorden van de ardennen tussen geilenkirchen en monschau tien divisies lagen
nl|tegenover de saar ten zuiden van de ardennen slechts vijf divisies waren gelegerd langs het
nl|circa tweehonderd kilometer lange front in de ardennen in de ardennen had al sinds september
nl|geen actie plaatsgevonden de amerikanen hadden hun beste troepen daarom vanuit het gebied verplaatst naar
nl|plaatsen waar wel hevig werd gevochten en hadden in de ardennen vooral onervaren of verzwakte
nl|troepen geplaatst zoals de e infanteriedivisie die over slechts vier dagen gevechtservaring beschikte en de
nl|e en e infanteriedivisie die beide zware verliezen hadden geleden in de slag om het
nl|h rtgenwald en aan een rustperiode toe waren op het front van deze drie divisies
nl|concentreerden de duitsers de felste aanvalskracht in eerste instantie werden de amerikanen volledig overrompeld de
nl|duitsers begonnen met een artilleriebombardement terwijl de troepen al snel oprukten naar de voor hen
nl|bestemde sectoren de amerikaanse voorposten kregen pas in de gaten wat de betekenis van de
nl|artilleriebeschieting was toen de eerste duitse troepen uit de mist tevoorschijn kwamen het weer was
nl|precies zoals hitler het gewenst had een laag wolkendek hield de duitse troepenbewegingen volkomen verborgen
nl|voor waarneming vanuit de lucht de geallieerde luchtstrijdkrachten bleven machteloos aan de grond toch verliep
nl|de duitse opmars niet zo snel als gehoopt hitler had gezien het beperkte aantal beschikbare
nl|tanks bevolen dat het front alleen door de infanterie gebroken mocht worden die doorbraak moest
nl|dan worden uitgebuit door de pantsertroepen de slecht getrainde volksgrenadiers bleken hierin niet zo effectief
nl|zo deden zich al de eerste vertragingen voor daarbij bleek het modderige terrein voor zware
nl|voertuigen bijna onbegaanbaar alleen in de noordelijke en zuidelijke sectoren van het front ondervonden de
nl|aanvallers flinke weerstand tussen b tgenbach en monschau waar het e pantserleger zich bevond met
nl|twee pantserdivisies en vier infanteriedivisies had zich het gevechtsklare amerikaanse e korps van gerow gevestigd
nl|dat een aanval voorbereidde op de roerdaldam toen de amerikanen de duitsers zagen aankomen namen
nl|ze defensieve stellingen in en trachtten ze de vijand af te stoppen op dit frontgedeelte
nl|liepen de duitsers storm tegen een onwrikbare muur op de heuvelrug bij elsenborn de amerikanen
nl|maakten hier optimaal gebruik van een van hun sterkste punten een zware korpsartillerie met centrale
nl|vuurleiding vuur van grote aantallen mm m long tom s kon snel op iedere duitse
nl|infanterieconcentratie verlegd worden dreigende doorbraken werden zo steeds afgestopt het standhouden van de schouder bij
nl|elsenborn was een grote tegenvaller voor de duitsers want zo ontbrak de ruimte om zich
nl|voor een aanval bij luik te ontplooien het hele pantserleger raakte verzeild in een enorme
nl|verkeersopstopping uitzondering was de speciale kampfgruppe peiper die de opdracht had iets zuidelijker dan elsenborn
nl|als pantserspits een route naar de maas te vinden en een ongeschonden brug te veroveren
nl|deze gevechtsgroep de ss pz abt omvattend uitgerust met de zware tiger ii k nigstiger
nl|zou in deze sector uiteindelijk de diepste penetratie bewerkstelligen ook in het zuiden slaagden de
nl|vier infanteriedivisies van het e duitse leger er niet in om door de amerikaanse e
nl|infanteriedivisie heen te breken in de middelste sector waar het e pantserleger opereerde met drie
nl|pantserdivisies en vier infanteriedivisies brak het front daarentegen wijd open langs de our werd de
nl|amerikaanse e infanteriedivisie die een front van zestig kilometer moest verdedigen zonder veel moeite opgerold
nl|door vijf duitse divisies in de sneeuweifel werden twee regimenten van de onervaren e divisie
nl|omsingeld de amerikanen hielden drie dagen stand in hun frontstellingen verwachtend dat hun pantserreserves de
nl|omsingeling zouden doorbreken toen hulp uitbleef en de munitie op raakte besloten hun officieren de
nl|eenheden in n keer over te geven in plaats van naar het westen uit te
nl|breken deze beslissing werd later zwaar bekritiseerd want dit vertegenwoordigde de grootse amerikaanse overgave ooit
nl|op het europese gevechtstoneel meer dan zesduizend man gingen in krijgsgevangenschap de verwarring achter het
nl|front was groot in de eerste uren van het offensief besefte het geallieerd hoofdkwartier aanvankelijk
nl|de ernst van de situatie niet de berichten van het front waren vaag verward en
nl|dikwijls spraken ze elkaar tegen het doel van de duitsers was niemand precies duidelijk het
nl|was moeilijk te geloven dat hitler werkelijk een enorm offensief was begonnen met antwerpen als
nl|doel men dacht daarom dat het ging om een verstorende aanval teneinde het komende offensief
nl|tegen de saar onder leiding van patton in de war te sturen daardoor werd de
nl|situatie door de amerikanen onderschat met als gevolg dat reserves te laat werden ingezet pas
nl|laat in de middag gaf eisenhower het bevel aan generaal omar bradley bevelhebber van de
nl|e legergroep dat twee pantserdivisies de e van het e leger in het noorden en
nl|de e van het e leger ten zuiden van de ardennen het e korps te
nl|hulp moesten komen het gebrek aan informatie was deels te wijten aan duitse saboteurs onder
nl|otto skorzeny die in de nacht voor de aanval in amerikaanse uniformen en jeeps ge
nl|nfiltreerd waren en achter het front een groot aantal telefoonlijnen hadden doorgesneden het oorspronkelijke plan
nl|van skorzeny s paard van troje groep operatie greif had tot doel met de onafhankelijke
nl|e pantserbrigade uitgerust met eerder buitgemaakte amerikaanse pantservoertuigen en vijf als m tankjagers vermomde panthertanks
nl|achter de linies brandstofvoorraden te bemachtigen en bruggen over de maas te bezetten dit plan
nl|kon niet worden uitgevoerd omdat dietrichs tanks in het noorden door het amerikaanse e korps
nl|werden tegengehouden uiteindelijk werd de e pb voor reguliere aanvallen ingezet zeven of acht jeeps
nl|met saboteurs die toch hadden kunnen infiltreren slaagden er echter wel in de verwarring achter
nl|het amerikaanse front nog aanzienlijk te vergroten de wildste geruchten deden de ronde over duizenden
nl|als amerikanen vermomde saboteurs de strenge veiligheidsmaatregelen die de amerikanen nu meenden te moeten doorvoeren
nl|vergrootten slechts de chaos en vertraagden de opmars van reserves naar het slagveld zelfs op
nl|het geallieerde hoofdkwartier in versailles werd de bewaking verscherpt omdat men daar had vernomen dat
nl|mannen van skorzeny van plan waren eisenhower te vermoorden een sprekend op eisenhower lijkende kolonel
nl|werd heen en weer gereden als lokaas verder deed een gerucht de ronde dat een
nl|saboteur vermomd als generaal rondliep om verwarring te stichten hier klopte niets van maar dit
nl|vergrootte de verwarring achter het front nog meer iedereen moest voortdurend vragen beantwoorden als wie
nl|is de nieuwe man van betty grable in welke league speelt die baseballploeg en hoe
nl|heet de vriendin van donald duck zelfs generaals ontsnapten hier niet aan de saboteurs werden
nl|allen snel gevat en de meesten werden ge xecuteerd toen in de nacht van op
nl|december duitse parachutisten achter het front landden werden de verwarring en paniek nog groter dat
nl|was dan ook vrijwel het enige dat de duitsers wisten te bereiken met deze parachutistenactie
nl|operatie st er want die was verder geen succes oorspronkelijk was het de bedoeling dat
nl|de parachutisten onder commando van kolonel baron friedrich august von der heydte het kruispunt eupen
nl|verviers zouden bezetten maar door zwaar afweervuur en onervarenheid van de piloten kwamen slechts tweehonderd
nl|manschappen terecht in het vastgestelde droppinggebied de anderen landden verspreid sommigen zelfs bij bonn en
nl|werden snel buiten gevecht gesteld von der heydte wist nog zo n driehonderd man te
nl|verzamelen maar achtte dat te weinig om het kruispunt te bezetten hij beperkte zich tot
nl|het onderscheppen van geallieerde koeriers toen de ss panzer division niet kwam opdagen besloot von
nl|der heydte naar het oosten uit te breken de meeste troepen waaronder hijzelf bereikten de
nl|duitse linies echter niet en waren gedwongen zich over te geven bij het vallen van
nl|de avond op december bleek dat de tanks van het e pantserleger belgi veertig kilometer
nl|waren binnengetrokken de sterke gevechtsgroep van joachim peiper stond zestien kilometer van het hoofdkwartier van
nl|het e leger in spa dat overhaast ontruimd moest worden en vlak bij twee grote
nl|opslagplaatsen van brandstof een kleiner depot hadden ze al veroverd zodat ze berhaupt verder konden
nl|rijden peipers mannen hadden zoveel haast dat ze niet de moeite namen krijgsgevangenen te maken
nl|toen zij in de loop van de dag rond uur vijf kilometer ten zuiden van
nl|malmedy op een eenheid van de amerikaanse e pantserdivisie stootten die snel uit de buurt
nl|van aken oprukte naar sankt vith gaven amerikanen van het e veldartillerie waarnemingsbataljon zich over
nl|aan de ss de gevangenen werden samengedreven op een akker en neergeschoten met mitrailleurs en
nl|machinepistolen een aantal van hen was slechts gewond hield zich dood en wist later naar
nl|een nabijgelegen bos te ontkomen er werden echter minstens krijgsgevangenen afgeslacht het bericht over deze
nl|oorlogsmisdaad verspreidde zich snel over de amerikaanse troepen waarvan velen besloten voortaan ss ers niet
nl|meer de gelegenheid te bieden zich over te geven sommigen vermoordden hierna duitse krijgsgevangenen daarin
nl|niet zelden ondersteund door hoge officieren peipers eenheid maakte zich ook in de dagen daarna
nl|schuldig aan oorlogsmisdaden volgens een rapport van de amerikaanse senaat uit vermoordden zijn manschappen tussen
nl|en december aantoonbaar krijgsgevangenen en burgers de overige eenheden van de amerikaanse e pantserdivisie bereikten
nl|in de loop van de middag en avond het wegenknooppunt sankt vith vanaf dat moment
nl|zou het stadje een amerikaanse vestingstad worden waar de duitsers voorlopig niet doorheen wisten te
nl|komen ze werden genoodzaakt er aan twee kanten omheen te trekken zodat hun opmars gesplitst
nl|werd ook in andere sectoren werd de amerikaanse tegenstand steeds heviger de linie monschau b
nl|tgenbach was nog altijd in handen van de amerikanen ondanks vergeefse pogingen van de duitsers
nl|tot een doorbraak het lukte kampfgruppe peiper niet om de maas te bereiken de zware
nl|tanks liepen steeds vast op de smalle en eenvoudig te blokkeren kronkelwegen op de steile
nl|hellingen van de vallei van de ambl ve waarvan de bruggen ook te zwak waren
nl|vlak voor een van de opslagplaatsen van brandstof werd peiper tot stilstand gebracht door een
nl|muur van brandende vaten benzine bron ondertussen werden de duitse troepen aangevallen door de amerikaanse
nl|e infanteriedivisie en moesten ze stavelot prijsgeven in de avond van december waren bovendien de
nl|amerikaanse e luchtlandingsdivisie en e luchtlandingsdivisie die bij reims in reserve lagen naar het ardennenfront
nl|gecommandeerd om te helpen de duitse opmars tot staan te brengen de e luchtlandingsdivisie werd
nl|naar het wegenknooppunt bastenaken bastogne gedirigeerd de vrachtauto s waarmee de mannen naar bastenaken werden
nl|gebracht reden s nachts met volle lichten aan van reims naar bouillon in belgi de
nl|nacht was helder en de vrachtauto s vormden een gemakkelijk doelwit voor duitse nachtjagers maar
nl|dat was een risico dat genomen moest worden aangezien men snel ter plaatse moest zijn
nl|volgens hitlers oorspronkelijke plan zou het zwaartepunt van de duitse aanval in het noorden moeten
nl|liggen toen de tanks van dietrich tussen monschau en b tgenbach echter op onbreekbaar verzet
nl|waren gestuit en von manteuffel er wel in geslaagd was ten zuiden van sankt vith
nl|een vierentwintig kilometer brede bres te slaan stelde walter model voor om vijf divisies uit
nl|het noorden ten zuiden van sankt vith in te zetten om zo veel mogelijk voordeel
nl|te trekken uit von manteuffels doorbraak hitler ging hier deels mee akkoord slechts drie divisies
nl|van de wehrmacht gingen naar het zuiden de ss divisies bleven in het noorden staan
nl|voor de amerikanen was de toestand nog steeds kritiek bradley had geen reserves meer en
nl|zag zich genoodzaakt het offensief van patton in de saar af te gelasten patton had
nl|inmiddels al n divisie afgestaan aan het front in de ardennen maar moest er nu
nl|meerdere afstaan hij meldde dat binnen uur drie divisies in de ardennen konden zijn patton
nl|ging direct aan de slag met een plan voor een tegenaanval op de duitse zuidflank
nl|eisenhower keurde dit plan goed en nu konden de generaals het uitvoeren het tegenoffensief zou
nl|volgens patton op december al kunnen beginnen voor het zover was zou de situatie in
nl|de ardennen echter nog aanzienlijk slechter worden in de avond van december hielden de sectoren
nl|in het noorden en zuiden nog steeds stand maar in het midden rukten de duitsers
nl|bijna ongehinderd verder op in de richting van de maas ook sankt vith was nog
nl|steeds in amerikaanse handen maar de duitsers waren aan weerskanten van dit stadje diep doorgestoten
nl|bovendien had sankt vith het zwaar te verduren gehad aangezien de duitsers in eerste instantie
nl|stormenderhand het amerikaanse bolwerk hadden willen innemen dat was ze uiteindelijk niet gelukt het e
nl|pantserleger was luik nu tot op dertig kilometer genaderd verder naar het zuiden had het
nl|e pantserleger houffalize genomen en naderde bastenaken ten westen daarvan hadden de amerikanen geen reserves
nl|in het pad van de duitse opmarsroute als de duitsers eenmaal de maas waren overgestoken
nl|zouden ze strategische bewegingsvrijheid verwerven en zou bradley niet kunnen voorkomen dat ze brussel konden
nl|bereiken de britse veldmaarschalk montgomery zag het potenti le gevaar van het vacu m tussen
nl|de maas en de belgische hoofdstad en bracht op eigen initiatief in hoog tempo het
nl|britse xxxe korps naar dit gebied over dat omvatte onder andere twee van zijn meest
nl|geharde en ervaren divisies de rd welsh en de st highlanders vanaf dat moment hadden
nl|ook de britten een klein aandeel in de slag om de ardennen nu de duitsers
nl|het ardennengebied in twee n hadden gesneden was het voor bradley die zijn hoofdkwartier in
nl|de stad luxemburg had erg lastig geworden om geregeld contact te houden met het hoofdkwartier
nl|van het eerste leger dat tot achter luik was teruggetrokken en in een staat van
nl|totale verwarring was geraakt mede om deze reden onthief eisenhower in de avond van december
nl|bradley van het commando over de geallieerde strijdkrachten ten noorden van de duitse wig hij
nl|plaatste de troepen onder bevel van montgomery op dat moment waren de amerikanen er nog
nl|steeds niet in geslaagd in het centrale deel van de ardennen een hecht front te
nl|vormen ze konden zich slechts beperken tot lokale gevechten hoewel de amerikanen redelijk standhielden in
nl|het noorden en in het zuiden kwam dit vooral door moed en vechtlust de verdediging
nl|verliep ongeco rdineerd en chaotisch montgomery bracht daar onmiddellijk verandering in toen hij op december
nl|het commando overnam hij had zich vanaf het begin van het duitse offensief voortdurend op
nl|de hoogte laten houden van de situatie aan het amerikaanse front door een aantal verbindingsofficieren
nl|die hij dagelijks naar de verschillende amerikaanse commandoposten zond en die hem iedere avond uitvoerig
nl|rapport uitbrachten toen hij op december het hoofdkwartier van generaal courtney hodges binnenstapte de commandant
nl|van het eerste leger was hij beter ge nformeerd dan de amerikaanse generaal zelf die
nl|ten prooi was gevallen aan een zenuwinzinking montgomery had intussen ook een goed inzicht in
nl|de duitse plannen dankzij het werk van de britse inlichtingendienst zo wist hij dat het
nl|e pantserleger de maas tussen luik en namen wilde oversteken en de amerikanen konden daarom
nl|een sterke aanval verwachten ten noordwesten van houffalize de geallieerden moesten volgens montgomery zo snel
nl|mogelijk een sterk en hecht front vormen tussen marche en famenne en stavelot hodges had
nl|echter geen reservetroepen meer waardoor hij troepen uit de voorste linie zou moeten terugtrekken om
nl|een goed front te kunnen vormen zo zou de frontlijn verkort en versterkt worden en
nl|zouden divisies vrijkomen voor eventuele tegenaanvallen hodges protesteerde echter en montgomery drong voorlopig niet aan
nl|beseffend dat de amerikaanse soldaat anders tegen een tactische terugtocht aankeek dan een brit hodges
nl|overwoog de e luchtlandingsdivisie sankt vith in te sturen wat montgomery een dwaas plan vond
nl|toen de situatie voor de bezetters van het ver vooruitgeschoven hoefijzer van sankt vith onhoudbaar
nl|werd en de commandant robert hasbrouck door hodges van zijn bevel werd ontheven omdat hij
nl|wilde terugtrekken greep montgomery in hasbrouck werd in zijn commando hersteld en zijn troepen trokken
nl|terug sankt vith werd daarop zwaar gebombardeerd door de geallieerden op december was de situatie
nl|in de ardennen kritiek in het noorden moest het e pantserleger in beginsel de oorspronkelijke
nl|opdracht uitvoeren om door te stoten naar de maas tussen luik en hoei maar was
nl|er nog steeds niet in geslaagd de heuvelrug bij elsenborn en de twee grote amerikaanse
nl|opslagplaatsen van brandstof te veroveren kampfgruppe peiper onderdeel van de e ss panzer division was
nl|bij stoumont de ambl ve overgestoken en had geprobeerd op te rukken richting werbomont ze
nl|stuitten echter op hevig verzet van de amerikaanse e luchtlandingsdivisie na hevige gevechten werden de
nl|troepen van de ss panzer division teruggedreven peiper dreigde ingesloten te raken en probeerde wanhopig
nl|weer naar het oosten uit te breken uiteindelijk was hij op december gedwongen zijn tanks
nl|op te geven en te voet naar de duitse linies te ontsnappen het e pantserleger
nl|zou er niet meer in slagen luik te bedreigen op de linkerflank van het e
nl|pantserleger was het e pantserleger er nog niet in geslaagd sankt vith en bastenaken te
nl|nemen maar stoottroepen hadden al de ourthe bereikt en naderden hotton het was voor de
nl|amerikanen van belang dat ze bastenaken het belangrijkste knooppunt van wegen in dit gebied in
nl|handen hielden op en december bevonden zich tussen de ourthe en de maas geen amerikaanse
nl|troepen op enkele genie eenheden en verspreide pantserpatrouilles na en de duitsers hadden zonder tegenstand
nl|kunnen oprukken naar namen en dinant het direct na aankomst zeer agressief optredende garnizoen van
nl|bastenaken hield echter met succes de duitse infanterie aan de oost zuid en noordzijde van
nl|de stad gedurende drie dagen tegen daarbij geholpen door een combat command van de amerikaanse
nl|e pantserdivisie de duitse pantserdivisies hadden opdracht het stadje te omtrekken maar hadden daarvoor geen
nl|ruimte zodat ook hier een gigantische verkeersopstopping ontstond verergerd door zware sneeuwval door dit oponthoud
nl|was de vaart uit von manteuffels opmars gehaald en werd hodges de gelegenheid geboden een
nl|verdedigingslinie op te zetten van marche en famenne tot grandmenil toen de duitsers er ondanks
nl|hun overmacht niet in slaagden de amerikaanse verdedigingsgordel rondom bastenaken te doorbreken restte hun niets
nl|anders dan de stad te omsingelen in de nacht van op december sloten zij de
nl|ring door de weg van bastenaken naar neufch teau te bezetten model kreeg van hitler
nl|de opdracht niet al te veel krachten aan bastenaken te verspillen maar verder op te
nl|rukken naar de maas dat was echter geen eenvoudige zaak nu de duitsers gedwongen waren
nl|om het door de amerikaanse troepen bezette bastenaken heen te trekken langs smalle slecht begaanbare
nl|binnenwegen in plaats van over de grote verkeersweg rechtstreeks naar marche en famenne en namen
nl|door te rijden het omrijden betekende veel tijdverlies voor de duitsers en elke dag raakten
nl|ze verder achter op schema wat winst was voor de amerikanen op december probeerden de
nl|duitsers nogmaals een doorbraak te forceren in de sector monschau b tgenbach malmedy zonder rekening
nl|te houden met hun verliezen bleven ze uur lang aanvallen uiteindelijk leverde dit nauwelijks terreinwinst
nl|op meer succes hadden de duitsers bij sankt vith van twee kanten drukten zij daar
nl|de amerikaanse saillant in elkaar en dwongen hasbroucks mannen terug te trekken over de salm
nl|nu lag de weg van sankt vith naar houffalize voor de duitsers open en toen
nl|op december ook saint hubert genomen was hadden zij een uitstekende verbinding van het noordoosten
nl|naar het zuidwesten een derde aanval werd uitgevoerd door de e ss pantserdivisie en de
nl|e ss pantserdivisie die laatste divisie was uit de strategische reserve vrijgegeven en aan het
nl|e pantserleger toegevoegd de aanval was gericht tegen de amerikaanse e luchtlandingsdivisie die bij de
nl|salm in stelling lag en nu genoodzaakt was om zich tot over deze rivier terug
nl|te trekken in het zuiden slaagde de duitse e pantserdivisie erin door te stoten naar
nl|celles in de avond van december stonden von manteuffels troepen nog slechts zestien kilometer van
nl|dinant en de maas ze hadden echter vrijwel geen brandstof en munitie meer vooralsnog maakte
nl|montgomery zich geen zorgen over deze duitse opmars hij was niet ontevreden over het verloop
nl|van de slag sinds december toen hij in het noorden het commando had overgenomen hij
nl|wist dat het oorspronkelijke plan van de duitsers was recht naar het westen door te
nl|stoten en dan tussen luik en namen de maas over te steken vanuit die positie
nl|was de afstand tot antwerpen het kleinst zij waren nu gedwongen af te zwenken naar
nl|het zuidwesten een gebied waar zij voorlopig weinig kwaad konden het speelde montgomery in de
nl|kaart dat von manteuffel nu de wegen van sankt vith naar la roche en saint
nl|hubert tot zijn beschikking had deze wegen liepen naar het zuidwesten en dat was precies
nl|de richting die montgomery de duitsers wilde dwingen te gaan hoe verder ze die kant
nl|optrokken hoe kwetsbaarder ze werden en de kans werd steeds kleiner dat zij nog voldoende
nl|krachten konden concentreren om een doorbraak te forceren tussen malmedy en marche en famenne om
nl|van daaruit de wegen naar het noordwesten open te breken in bastenaken begon het belegerde
nl|garnizoen zich inmiddels ernstig zorgen te maken over de langzame opmars van het e leger
nl|generaal anthony mcauliffe de garnizoenscommandant had op december vol vertrouwen een ultimatum van heinrich von
nl|l ttwitz afgewezen met een legendarisch kort antwoord nuts de duitse generaal dreigde de stad
nl|in puin te schieten als de e luchtlandingsdivisie zich niet binnen twee uur eervol zou
nl|overgeven de amerikaanse generaal mcauliffe vond het ultimatum volkomen onzinnig want hij was ervan overtuigd
nl|dat zijn troepen druk bezig waren de duitsers ervan langs te geven en hij maakte
nl|zich niet erg ongerust over het feit dat ze waren omsingeld voor luchtlandingstroepen een normale
nl|situatie mcauliffe had zelf een krachtige artillerie met vuurmonden in feite meer dan de duitsers
nl|tegen bastenaken konden inzetten het aangekondigde zware artilleriebombardement op de stad bleef uit maar die
nl|nacht viel de luftwaffe bastenaken aan met junkers ju s en de volgende vier nachten
nl|zouden de bombardementen met de regelmaat van de klok worden herhaald de duitsers bleven de
nl|amerikaanse verdedigingscirkel rond bastenaken aftasten maar zagen voorlopig af van een grootscheepse aanval toch werd
nl|de situatie voor de e luchtlandingsdivisie op december kritiek de oorzaak was een ernstig tekort
nl|aan munitie brandstof en voedsel kolonel thomas sherburne die in de loop van de dag
nl|de ronde maakte langs de amerikaanse batterijen kwam tot de conclusie dat er minder dan
nl|tien granaten waren voor elk stuk zwaar geschut en onmiddellijk ging dan ook de order
nl|uit alleen te vuren indien echt geraakt zou worden nog altijd had men goede hoop
nl|op een spoedig ontzet en inderdaad slaagde een pantsercolonne van het e leger erin langs
nl|de weg aarlen bastenaken de vesting tot op tien kilometer te naderen een felle duitse
nl|tegenaanval dwong de mannen van patton echter weer tot de terugtocht het weer klaarde in
nl|de morgen van december op waardoor c transportvliegtuigen ton voorraden en munitie in bastenaken konden
nl|afwerpen de volgende dag keerden de c s terug en wierpen nogmaals honderd ton af
nl|het was niet genoeg maar het voorbeeld van de logge toestellen die laag dwars door
nl|het zware duitse afweervuur vlogen en hun koers niet wijzigden ook al stortten andere links
nl|en rechts brandend neer gaf de ingesloten troepen zoveel moed dat zij bereid waren nog
nl|wekenlang genoegen te nemen met schamele maaltijden ook werd met een vrachtzweefvliegtuig een chirurgisch team
nl|afgezet het oorspronkelijke veldlazaret van de e luchtlandingsdivisie was al vroeg in de strijd ten
nl|westen van bastenaken door de duitsers overrompeld de verbetering in het weer had ook voor
nl|andere sectoren een geallieerd voordeel niet alleen kon de luchtmacht nu de verdedigers van bastenaken
nl|krachtig steunen door de duitse stellingen te bombarderen ook von manteuffels speerpunt voor dinant kreeg
nl|het zwaar te verduren de sneeuw die enige dagen daarvoor was gevallen hielp de geallieerde
nl|piloten hun doelen te vinden tanks en infanterieconcentraties staken duidelijk af tegen de witte ondergrond
nl|en overal verraadden sporen van rupsbanden de posities van tanks die verdekt waren opgesteld in
nl|de bossen al snel stonden op veel plaatsen de dennenbossen in brand en werden oprukkende
nl|duitse colonnes uiteengeslagen de slag begon zich nu in snel tempo in geallieerd voordeel te
nl|keren von manteuffel en model beseften nu dat zij antwerpen onmogelijk zouden kunnen bereiken en
nl|dat zij nog maar weinig kans hadden de maas over te steken behalve door de
nl|steeds krachtiger wordende tegenstand van de amerikanen en de aanvallen uit de lucht werd de
nl|verdere duitse opmars ook verstoord door een ernstig benzinetekort hitler had zijn belofte niet gehouden
nl|over de hoeveelheid brandstof en daardoor konden de duitsers niet meer snel oprukken model legde
nl|daarom aan hitler een nieuw plan voor het beste zou zijn op de westflank bij
nl|dinant een sterk front te handhaven terwijl von manteuffel tussen de maas en de ourthe
nl|naar het noorden zou stoten en dietrich tussen de ourthe en de salm als dan
nl|ook van de roer uit een offensief in de richting van maastricht geopend zou worden
nl|kon aken worden heroverd hitler ging met dit voorstel akkoord voorwaarde voor het slagen van
nl|dit plan was echter dat eerst bastenaken zou worden veroverd voor dit nieuwe offensief op
nl|bastenaken bracht von manteuffel de verse e pantsergrenadierdivisie naar de noordwestelijke sector van de omsingelingsring
nl|in de kerstnacht begrepen de verdedigers van bastenaken dat een nieuwe aanval op komst was
nl|twee keer werden de amerikaanse parachutisten tijdens hun kerstfeest verstoord door aanvallen van de luftwaffe
nl|de grondaanval begon vroeg in de morgen van de eerste kerstdag in het donker slaagden
nl|enkele infanterietroepen door de amerikaanse verdediging heen te breken en even later waren het de
nl|tanks die een gat sloegen in het amerikaanse verdedigingsfront mcauliffe had met deze mogelijkheid rekening
nl|gehouden en antitankgeschut stond zodanig opgesteld dat het de binnendringende duitse tanks aan beide flanken
nl|onder vuur kon nemen alle achttien duitse tanks werden uitgeschakeld en aan het eind van
nl|de ochtend was het gat in de amerikaanse frontlijn weer gedicht diezelfde morgen stond de
nl|voorhoede van de duitse e pantserdivisie op de heuvelrug bij dinant gereed om door te
nl|stoten naar de maas zodra voldoende benzine en versterkingen waren gearriveerd verkenningspatrouilles hadden vastgesteld dat
nl|aan de oever van de maas een linie britse tanks stond opgesteld die waren van
nl|e pantserbrigade wat de duitsers niet wisten was dat de amerikaanse e pantserdivisie oprukte naar
nl|hun noordflank tegen de middag hadden de amerikanen de toevoerweg naar dinant afgesneden en de
nl|bossen bij celles waarin de tanks van de duitse voorhoede zich hadden genesteld omsingeld twee
nl|dagen vochten de duitsers om de omsingeling te doorbreken aan de andere kant van de
nl|omsingeling probeerde de e pantserdivisie vergeefs hun omsingelde kameraden te ontzetten tegen de avond van
nl|december was de speerpunt van von manteuffels e pantserleger vernietigd en trokken de andere divisies
nl|terug op rochefort hiermee was voor de duitsers de kans de maas over te steken
nl|voorgoed verloren ook op eerste en tweede kerstdag bleven de amerikaanse en britse luchtmacht bij
nl|helder weer de duitse stellingen en aanvoerwegen zwaar bestoken ook de infrastructuur in het rijnland
nl|kreeg het zwaar te verduren in de vroege morgen van december probeerden de duitsers een
nl|nog grotere druk uit te oefenen op de amerikaanse troepen in bastenaken de amerikanen vochten
nl|verbeten terug en hielden stand intussen naderden uit het zuidwesten de tanks van pattons e
nl|leger steeds dichter de omsingelde stad om drie uur in de middag was de voorhoede
nl|bastenaken tot op acht kilometer genaderd pattons tanks begonnen juist het dorpje sibret aan te
nl|vallen toen zij honderden transportvliegtuigen over zagen vliegen op weg naar bastenaken dit gaf de
nl|troepen zoveel moed dat zij besloten sibret te laten voor wat het was en rechtstreeks
nl|door te stoten naar bastenaken om daar de e luchtlandingsdivisie te ontzetten om tien voor
nl|vijf bereikten de eerste amerikaanse tanks de linie van de e luchtlandingsdivisie het ontzet kwam
nl|geen dag te vroeg want vooral voor de gewonden burgers en militairen in de noodhospitalen
nl|was de toestand onhoudbaar geworden in een kerk lagen de gewonden in lange rijen op
nl|de vloer en zo dicht bijeen dat ze nauwelijks bereikt konden worden door de hospitaalsoldaten
nl|en verpleegsters een militaire arts beschreef de situatie in bastenaken als volgt de gewonden werden
nl|neergelegd op zaagsel en toegedekt met dekens en parachutes tegen de achtermuur werden diegenen gelegd
nl|die niet zouden herstellen als er weer iemand gestorven was werd hij naar een ander
nl|gebouw gebracht naarmate het weer kouder werd kwamen er steeds meer mannen met bevroren voeten
nl|binnen zij werden in een apart gebouw gelegd en van de nek tot de enkels
nl|bedekt hun voeten moesten bloot blijven in de kerstnacht werd een van de verzamelplaatsen voor
nl|gewonden getroffen door een brandbom iedereen die gemist kon worden ging erheen om de gewonden
nl|naar buiten te brengen later werd de situatie beter maar nog altijd stierven er veel
nl|mensen die gered hadden kunnen worden als we ze beter hadden kunnen verzorgen en behandelen
nl|daarom zonden we onderhandelaars naar de duitsers om te vragen of wij onze ernstigste pati
nl|nten door de duitse linies mochten evacueren de duitse commandant zei dat hij erover na
nl|zou denken en de volgende dag zijn antwoord zou geven maar toen was het niet
nl|meer nodig want pattons voorhoede had ons al bereikt en achter de tanks reden veertig
nl|ambulances de stad in om de meest ernstige gevallen met spoed naar elders af te
nl|voeren het verloop van de duitse operaties van tot december had duidelijk aangetoond dat de
nl|verwachtingen van het duitse opperbevel veel te hooggespannen waren geweest de slechte toestand van de
nl|wegen de ontoereikende geoefendheid van de aanvallende eenheden het toenemende gebrek aan brandstof en vooral
nl|het massale ingrijpen van de geallieerde luchtmacht na december toen het weer was opgeklaard waren
nl|te veel voor de duitse troepen daarbovenop kwam de vastberaden weerstand van de amerikanen in
nl|de sector bastenaken von rundstedt en model moesten al op december in een dagrapport melden
nl|dat het duitse offensief over zijn hoogtepunt heen was de duitsers werden met de dag
nl|meer bestookt op december besloot von rundstedt dat noch het oorspronkelijke doel van het offensief
nl|antwerpen noch de kleine doelstelling dat wil zeggen de vernietiging van de geallieerde troepen ten
nl|oosten van de maas te verwezenlijken was hij verzocht hitler om het offensief af te
nl|gelasten en toe te staan dat de eenheden zich tot aan de westwall terugtrokken dit
nl|om te voorkomen dat het de geallieerden zou lukken de duitse aanvalswig af te snijden
nl|en te vernietigen hitler wilde hier echter niets van weten integendeel hij beval het e
nl|pantserleger de hoogte bij marche en famenne in bezit te nemen hij hoopte dat de
nl|toenemende geallieerde druk op de zuidelijke flank van het e pantserleger zou verminderen als de
nl|voor begin januari vastgestelde aanval van heeresgruppe g in de noordelijke elzas zou starten nadat
nl|hitler en jodl een situatiebeoordeling hadden ontvangen van december stelde jodl vast dat de geallieerde
nl|tegenaanval tussen stavelot en monschau was vastgelopen de linkervleugel van het e pantserleger zou daardoor
nl|meer bewegingsvrijheid krijgen het e pantserleger was volgens jodl echter zonder voldoende flankdekking doorgebroken naar
nl|het zuiden en het noorden daardoor bestond de mogelijkheid dat het zou worden afgesneden bij
nl|het e leger was alleen sprake van een plaatselijke strijd volgens jodl zou de voorgenomen
nl|doorbraak over de maas naar het noordwesten daardoor nog altijd mogelijk zijn deze hing echter
nl|af van het herstel van het evenwicht aan de sauer en de mogelijkheid om de
nl|geallieerde krachten tussen de ourthe en de maas ten noorden van de lijn marche en
nl|famenne dinant te vernietigen hitler gaf onmiddellijk bevelen aan de commandanten op het slagveld tegelijkertijd
nl|verscheen generaal heinz guderian die chef staf was voor het oostfront in het hoofdkwartier en
nl|vroeg dringend om hulp voor zijn heeresgruppe s d in de sector boedapest deze was
nl|daar in een zware strijd geraakt met het rode leger het lukte hem n divisie
nl|los te krijgen kort daarop moest nog eens een divisie worden overgebracht naar het in
nl|moeilijkheden geraakte oostfront waardoor de krachten van de duitsers aan het westelijke front opnieuw werden
nl|verzwakt dit had als gevolg dat de voorgenomen aanval van heeresgruppe h in nederland over
nl|de maas in de richting van antwerpen onmogelijk werd ondanks alles hield hitler nog altijd
nl|verbeten vast aan zijn besluit het offensief moest zo snel mogelijk weer worden voortgezet op
nl|de avond van december beval hij de situatie rondom bastenaken onder alle omstandigheden tot een
nl|gunstig resultaat te brengen door geconcentreerde aanvallen op de flanken van de tegenstander moest deze
nl|vernietigd worden in een nieuwe beoordeling van de situatie kwamen de generaals van het westelijke
nl|front op december tot de conclusie dat het voortzetten van het offensief zinloos was geworden
nl|het was de tegenstander gelukt door de aanvoer van twee ntwintig divisies een gesloten afweerfront
nl|op te bouwen rondom de duitse aanvalswig bovendien gingen de geallieerden in het zuiden over
nl|tot de aanval als er ondanks alles toch werd gedacht aan een offensieve oorlogvoering kon
nl|dit alleen als er nieuwe troepen beschikbaar werden gesteld op dezelfde dag riep hitler de
nl|bevelhebbers bijeen van heeresgruppe g die deelnamen aan het offensief in de noordelijke elzas operatie
nl|nordwind op deze bijeenkomst moest hitler toegeven dat het ardennenoffensief helaas niet tot het gewenste
nl|doorslaggevend succes had geleid maar hij verklaarde met nadruk dat in ieder geval een enorme
nl|ontspanning van de situatie in het westen tot stand was gekomen omdat de tegenstander zijn
nl|hele aanvalsplan had moeten wijzigen de nieuwe taak van heeresgruppe b was om met haar
nl|divisies zo veel mogelijk geallieerde krachten te binden hitler hoopte overigens dat na het slagen
nl|van de operatie in de noordelijke elzas het ardennenoffensief voortgezet kon worden en met succes
nl|zou kunnen worden be indigd alleen voortdurende offensieven zouden de oorlog in het westen een
nl|gunstige wending kunnen geven althans dat was de mening die hitler was toegedaan was eenmaal
nl|de ene helft van het geallieerde kamp uitgeschakeld dan zou de overblijvende tegenstander tegen de
nl|opmarcherende vijfenveertig duitse divisies geen weerstand meer kunnen bieden daarom bleef in het westen de
nl|absolute doelstelling intact de zaak offensief tot een goed einde te brengen als het front
nl|in het westen was gestabiliseerd dan zou het duitse leger ook in het zuiden en
nl|oosten in staat zijn de fronten te behouden vervolgens zette hitler nog een keer zijn
nl|plannen en doelen op papier en liet deze aan zijn militaire staf zien het ging
nl|in deze strijd tenslotte om het zijn of niet zijn van het duitse rijk en
nl|de nationaalsocialistische wereldbeschouwing het kwam er nu op aan de wezenlijke waarden van het duitse
nl|volk te behouden en tegelijkertijd de plaats van het reich als grote natie definitief veilig
nl|te stellen niemand mocht twijfelen aan zijn vastberadenheid om de oorlog voort te zetten op
nl|december had guderian een telefoongesprek met het duitse hoofdkwartier hij ging diep in op de
nl|wanverhouding in kracht bij het verwachte winteroffensief van het rode leger hij vreesde voor een
nl|ineenstorting van het oostfront en drong sterk aan het offensief in de ardennen te be
nl|indigen en alle beschikbare krachten over te brengen naar het oostelijke front hitler wenste de
nl|operatie in het westen voort te zetten daar moest naar hitlers gedachte de beslissing vallen
nl|intussen had heeresgruppe g om het initiatief in handen te houden aan het westfront een
nl|begin gemaakt met operatie nordwind de aan beide zijden van bitche aanvallende legeronderdelen wonnen echter
nl|maar weinig terrein in de richting van de sector moder twee dagen later ging veldmaarschalk
nl|montgomery op de noordelijke flank van de duitse aanvalsvleugel tot het tegenoffensief over op januari
nl|gaf hitler de generaals het plan voor de verdere oorlogvoering hij gaf weliswaar toe dat
nl|zijn oorspronkelijke plan geen kans op verwezenlijking had maar stelde toch vast dat hij de
nl|tegenstander het initiatief had ontnomen het doel van de strijd in het westen was nog
nl|altijd het initiatief niet uit handen te geven en de geallieerden door verdere kleine aanvallen
nl|tot versplintering van hun krachten te dwingen op die manier zou het eisenhower op de
nl|meest doeltreffende wijze onmogelijk worden gemaakt een groot offensief in het westen te beginnen hitler
nl|gaf de generaals in het westen het bevel in bepaalde door hem aangewezen sectoren onder
nl|alle omstandigheden het initiatief te behouden heeresgruppe b moest de tegenstander voor het front vasthouden
nl|rondom bastenaken verslaan en vervolgens een sterk front in het zuiden opbouwen heeresgruppe g moest
nl|de geallieerden tussen de vogezen en de rijn vernietigen en als uitgangspunt voor de voortzetting
nl|van het offensief de westelijke uitvalswegen van de vogezen in handen zien te krijgen en
nl|te behouden heeresgruppe oberrhein waarvan hitler op november aan himmler het bevel had opgedragen moest
nl|ter ondersteuning van de aanval van heeresgruppe g een bruggenhoofd ten noorden van straatsburg vormen
nl|dat de geallieerden op sommige punten diep in het duitse front waren doorgedrongen bracht hitler
nl|op januari eindelijk tot het inzicht dat zijn strijdkrachten in de ardennen alleen nog maar
nl|te redden waren als ze zo spoedig mogelijk werden teruggetrokken op diezelfde dag beval hij
nl|het front terug te trekken op de lijn dochamps longchamps al op januari moest hij
nl|toestemmen in een verdere terugtocht toen ook de operatie nordwind was vastgelopen op en januari
nl|was het grote winteroffensief van de sovjet unie tussen de karpaten en de oostzee begonnen
nl|tegen het einde van januari werden de duitse troepen ten slotte teruggetrokken naar hun uitgangsstellingen
nl|in de westwall met het bevel van het okw van januari om het i ss
nl|pantserkorps leibstandarte naar wenen te verplaatsen legde hitler schriftelijk vast dat hij definitief afzag van
nl|een offensieve strategie in het westen gezien de catastrofale toestand in het oosten was geen
nl|ander besluit mogelijk hitlers beslissingen van november tot januari hebben nog eenmaal heel duidelijk zijn
nl|onverminderde koppigheid ten aanzien van de operatieve oorlogvoering aangetoond door zijn fanatieke wil wist hij
nl|vaak het onbereikbare toch nog af te dwingen toch had hij de tegenstander en diens
nl|potentieel onderschat en zijn eigen mogelijkheden overschat gezien de krachtsverhoudingen was zijn besluit om tot
nl|een offensief in het westen over te gaan niet te verklaren de inzet van de
nl|laatste strategische reserves van het duitse leger aan het westfront kwam in de eerste plaats
nl|het rode leger ten goede dit kon de duitse stellingen nu sneller oprollen dan misschien
nl|mogelijk was geweest bij de inzet van alle beschikbare duitse reserves aan het oostfront tweede
nl|kerstdag was het keerpunt in de slag in de ardennen de tanks van het amerikaanse
nl|e leger stuitten de duitsers bij dinant meer naar het oosten was het de amerikanen
nl|van het e leger gelukt de verbinding tot stand te brengen met de amerikanen in
nl|bastenaken op december trokken de duitse tanks zich verder van dinant terug heel wat tanks
nl|moesten echter worden achtergelaten omdat er geen benzine meer was de eerste fase van de
nl|slag was voorbij de duitsers waren tot staan gebracht en daardoor kon de tweede fase
nl|beginnen het terugdringen van de duitsers uit belgi en luxemburg ook na december bleef de
nl|strijd zich vooral concentreren rond bastenaken heuvels en dalen waren met een dikke sneeuwlaag bedekt
nl|waardoor een gemotoriseerde opmars alleen mogelijk was via wegen dat maakte de slag in de
nl|ardennen tot een strijd om de spaarzame verbindingswegen dit leidde vooral tot een slag om
nl|het kruispunt van de twee belangrijkste wegen bij bastenaken de oost westverbinding die de duitsers
nl|nodig hadden om hun troepen aan de maas te brengen en de zuid noordverbinding die
nl|de amerikanen moesten gebruiken om de duitsers af te snijden al vanaf december voerde patton
nl|vanuit aarlen zijn troepen aan twee weken lang werd vlak bij bastenaken fel verbeten in
nl|sneeuw ijs en kou gevochten de amerikaanse verliezen waren groot dit kwam mede doordat onervaren
nl|amerikaanse troepen stonden tegenover een tegenstander die in rusland al drie wintercampagnes achter de rug
nl|had intussen bereidde eisenhower een grootscheepse omsingeling van de duitsers voor op december bezocht hij
nl|montgomery in hasselt afgesproken werd dat montgomery op januari met het amerikaanse e leger en
nl|een brits legerkorps een aanval in zuidelijke richting zou lanceren de bedoeling was dat men
nl|met een aanval vanuit het zuiden en het noorden in de richting van houffalize zou
nl|proberen de duitsers de pas af te snijden daarna zou men hen insluiten zoals men
nl|dat in augustus met zoveel succes bij falaise had gedaan maar voor die aanval werd
nl|ingezet waren het de duitsers die nog twee keer aanvielen de eerste aanval speelde zich
nl|af in de lucht en de tweede werd op de grond uitgevoerd op nieuwjaarsdag vond
nl|operatie bodenplatte plaats waarmee de luftwaffe een poging waagde om de taak van de grondtroepen
nl|te verlichten dit was de laatste massale aanval van de luftwaffe tijdens de tweede wereldoorlog
nl|vroeg in de morgen stegen duitse jachtvliegtuigen op ze hadden als doel meegekregen om de
nl|geallieerde vliegvelden hangars en vliegtuigen in nederland belgi luxemburg en noord frankrijk te verwoesten er
nl|werden vele vernielingen aangericht zo werden driehonderd geallieerde vliegtuigen op de grond vernietigd of beschadigd
nl|waaronder ook montgomery s dakota er werden echter maar weinig piloten uitgeschakeld de duitse verliezen
nl|waren eveneens groot circa driehonderd toestellen gingen verloren vele werden door de eigen luchtafweer neergehaald
nl|vooral op de terugweg dit was het gevolg van geheimhouding zodat zelfs de bemanning van
nl|het duitse afweergeschut niet op tijd gewaarschuwd was ook vlogen hele eskaders rechtstreeks in het
nl|geconcentreerde afweervuur dat de geallieerden op de invliegroutes van de v wapens hadden opgesteld omdat
nl|verscheidene doelen samenvielen met die van de v wapens daardoor verloor de luftwaffe eveneens veel
nl|vliegtuigen daarbij maakte g ring de fout een opvolgende aanval in de middag uit te
nl|voeren de jagers die daaraan deelnamen werden voor een groot deel in luchtgevechten neergehaald onder
nl|de piloten waren veel commandanten die niet konden worden vervangen de aanval leidde daarmee tot
nl|een ernstige relatieve verzwakking van de luftwaffe eveneens op januari zette hitler een nieuw offensief
nl|in de elzas in operatie nordwind vanuit hun westwall posities braken de duitsers ten westen
nl|en ten oosten van bitche met acht divisies naar het zuiden uit op januari trokken
nl|ze ook bij wissembourg het zuiden in op en januari gingen nieuwe eenheden ten noorden
nl|en ten zuiden van straatsburg over de rijn de bedoeling was het insluiten van het
nl|amerikaanse e leger van generaal jacob devers e legergroep dit leger had in de elzas
nl|een vooruitgeschoven positie ingenomen maar anders dan in de ardennen kwam de aanval in de
nl|elzas niet onverwacht de geallieerde inlichtingendienst had goed werk verricht en de amerikanen wisten van
nl|het plan eisenhower was niet van plan troepen uit de ardennen weg te halen hoewel
nl|hij wist dat devers legers het amerikaanse e en het franse e leger niet tegen
nl|een grootscheepse aanval opgewassen leken mochten de duitsers te sterk blijken dan moesten de amerikaanse
nl|troepen insluiting zien te voorkomen en zo nodig een groot deel van de elzas prijsgeven
nl|daardoor zou straatsburg echter opnieuw in duitse handen kunnen vallen voor de fransen zou dit
nl|een enorme vernedering zijn en daarom deelde een woedende de gaulle op januari aan eisenhower
nl|mee dat hij in geval van nood straatsburg door het hele franse leger zou laten
nl|verdedigen zelfs de stad niet zou ontruimen en zijn troepen onder zijn eigen opperbevel zou
nl|brengen in plaats van dat van eisenhower dat deed eisenhower besluiten zijn instructies te wijzigen
nl|devers mocht terugtrekken maar kreeg bevel straatsburg in ieder geval te houden de gaulle zag
nl|door zijn dreigement zijn eigenlijke bedoeling dus verwezenlijkt slechts in het noorden boekten de duitsers
nl|tot januari behoorlijke terreinwinst tot voorbij haguenau in het zuiden hernamen fransen en amerikanen op
nl|januari het initiatief en begonnen met de opruiming van de zak van colmar een actie
nl|die begin februari zou worden voltooid op januari begon de geco rdineerde geallieerde tegenaanval in
nl|de ardennen montgomery zou vanuit het noorden over een front van veertig kilometer met het
nl|amerikaanse e leger en het britse xxxe legerkorps naar het zuiden trekken waar het amerikaanse
nl|e leger vanuit het zuiden naar het noorden trok montgomery kwam aanvankelijk maar zeer langzaam
nl|vooruit mede omdat het weer slecht was met een sneeuwdek van een meter en felle
nl|koude daardoor waren de wegen glad en het zicht bedroeg doorgaans niet meer dan tweehonderd
nl|meter hevige sneeuwval legde de aanvallen zelfs een paar dagen stil en ook daarna moest
nl|meter voor meter worden veroverd op een tegenstander die zich met tanks en antitankgeschut in
nl|het onherbergzame landschap had ingegraven in het zuiden waar omar bradley het bevel voerde was
nl|de strijd niet minder zwaar nog altijd wilde hitler bastenaken veroveren de duitsers concentreerden hier
nl|tien divisies op schaarse middelen werden zo verspild aan een prestigekwestie de felle aanvallen maakten
nl|het de amerikanen nog knap lastig de amerikaanse e pantserdivisie werd frontaal teruggedrongen door de
nl|ss panzer division hitlerjugend alleen een artilleriebarrage kon een ineenstorting voorkomen vanaf januari nam de
nl|duitse druk af hoewel montgomery en bradley maar weinig vorderden werd de toestand voor de
nl|duitsers nu zeer hachelijk op januari stonden ten westen van de lijn luik houffalize bastenaken
nl|zeven duitse pantserdivisies en er was nog maar n weg terug door houffalize dat stadje
nl|was echter in de nacht van januari platgebombardeerd om de duitse bewegingen te hinderen het
nl|lag daarna onder continu geallieerd spervuur nu werd het ook hitler duidelijk dat een omsingeling
nl|dreigde hij gaf op januari bevel tot een beperkte terugtocht achter deze lijn de volgende
nl|dag merkten de geallieerden dat vooral de duitse pantsereenheden zich begonnen los te maken van
nl|het front de ss eenheden werden met voorrang gered langzaam gingen in de daaropvolgende dagen
nl|de geallieerden vooruit op januari viel la roche en ardenne in handen van de geallieerden
nl|op januari werd saint hubert veroverd en op januari reikten de soldaten van het uit
nl|het noorden komende amerikaanse e leger en het uit het zuiden komende amerikaanse e leger
nl|elkaar de hand te midden van de puinhopen van houffalize op dat moment waren alle
nl|grotere duitse eenheden al naar het oosten ontsnapt een dag later kwam het amerikaanse e
nl|leger weer onder commando van bradley het amerikaanse e leger bleef onder montgomery het was
nl|een oplossing die geen van beide bevelhebbers tevreden stelde hoewel eisenhowers eerdere beslissing het e
nl|en e leger onder bevel van montgomery te brengen militair gezien juist was geweest had
nl|bradley dit moeilijk kunnen verkroppen montgomery poogde zelfs weer overkoepelend operationeel bevelhebber te worden van
nl|alle troepen aan het westfront overall field forces commander zoals hij tijdens de slag om
nl|normandi geweest was pas toen zijn eigen staf hem duidelijk maakte dat een ge rgerde
nl|eisenhower op het punt stond van de britse regering te eisen dat men hem naar
nl|het vaderland terug zou roepen bond montgomery in in een persconferentie over de slag deed
nl|hij het echter in zelfgenoegzame bewoordingen voorkomen alsof hij die in zijn eentje geleid en
nl|tot een goed einde gebracht had de duitse propagandadienst stookte nog eens extra tussen beide
nl|bondgenoten door valse britse radioprogramma s uit te zenden die montgomery ophemelden en bradley als
nl|een incompetente sukkel voorstelden die alleen door britse hulp een totale nederlaag bespaard was gebleven
nl|met de verovering van houffalize was de duitse saillant opgeruimd en was de slag om
nl|de ardennen strategisch gezien ten einde in de daaropvolgende twaalf dagen drongen de amerikanen de
nl|duitsers terug naar de westwall mede door acties van de geallieerde luchtmacht verloren de duitsers
nl|op de weg terug nog grote hoeveelheden materieel voor het overige liep de slag langzaam
nl|ten einde gedurende de laatste twee weken werkte men in de geallieerde stafkwartieren in hoofdzaak
nl|aan de plannen voor de aanval op de roer en rijn op januari had hitler
nl|zijn hoofdkwartier in ziegenberg verlaten en was naar berlijn gegaan het e pantserleger werd op
nl|januari uit de ardennen teruggeroepen om het aan het oostfront te kunnen inzetten want op
nl|januari waren de sovjettroepen in beweging gekomen voor hun reusachtige offensief over de weichsel eind
nl|januari werd de frontlijn van december weer bereikt aan het oostfront werden de duitsers echter
nl|steeds verder teruggedrongen oost pruisen werd afgesneden van het reich en het rode leger bereikte
nl|de oder tevens wisten de sovjets het opper silezische industriegebied te veroveren in het late
nl|najaar van waren de geallieerden zo gewend geraakt te denken dat de wehrmacht op het
nl|punt stond ineen te storten dat het ardennenoffensief als een volslagen verrassing kwam het offensief
nl|leidde op verschillende plaatsen tot paniekreacties zij het niet op het hoogste niveau vooral eisenhower
nl|bewees zijn grote kwaliteiten als co rdinator die de spanningen in het geallieerde kamp die
nl|met de fransen over straatsburg en die tussen bradley en montgomery over de bevelvoering goed
nl|wist te beheersen hoewel de britten ook hebben meegestreden in de slag om de ardennen
nl|was hun rol beperkt slechts van de geallieerde verliezen kwamen voor hun rekening naast het
nl|grote verlies aan mensenlevens ging ook een groot aantal tanks verloren in de ardennen werden
nl|tanks door de duitsers buiten gevecht gesteld daarnaast gingen vliegtuigen verloren voor de duitsers waren
nl|de menselijke en materi le verliezen tijdens deze gedurfde aanval eveneens groot in de ardennen
nl|werden duitse tanks vliegtuigen en voertuigen door de geallieerden onherstelbaar beschadigd hitler wist met zijn
nl|offensief de frontale aanval op de westwall zes weken uit te stellen het grote verschil
nl|tussen de geallieerde en de duitse verliezen was dat de geallieerde vervangen konden worden en
nl|de duitse niet de duitsers konden bressen in het front nu niet meer dichten de
nl|geallieerden konden nu zowel vanuit het westen als vanuit het oosten doorstoten naar het volgende
nl|doel het ardennenoffensief beroofde het oostfront van een dringend noodzakelijke pantserreserve in het oosten konden
nl|de duitsers de doorgebroken troepen van de sovjet unie niet stoppen en daardoor stonden de
nl|sovjets al snel vlak voor berlijn de duitse troepen verspreid over twee fronten zouden tegen
nl|de oprukkende legers nooit het tij kunnen keren naast de fronten in het oosten en
nl|het westen was er nog het italiaanse front in het zuiden waar ruim duitse troepen
nl|met zo n italianen stonden opgesteld elk jaar wordt de slag om de ardennen herdacht
nl|in bastenaken daarvoor reizen onder andere amerikaanse oud strijders en hun familie af naar belgi
nl|de slag om de ardennen is een populair thema in de media dat met grote
nl|regelmaat voorkomt in films en computergames de slag om de ardennen komt voor in de
nl|onderstaande films de slag om de ardennen komt voor in de onderstaande computergames
